Michael Bellato, Senior Data Scientist at Spotify, observed Backstage activity for the first half of 2022 for developers. After observing that group, he measured developer activities, retention, and satisfaction for the same group for the next 6 months to a year. For simplicity, this pre-post approach in our analysis does not account for potential seasonality effects. As well, given the level of adoption for Backstage within Spotify with our internal developer community, there was no possibility to carry out our analysis by using a control group of non Backstage users. We therefore used observational methods to determine Backstage\u2019s value and grouped users into 2 categories: frequent and less frequent users. In order to ensure both groups of users were as comparable as possible, we then controlled and matched factors such as their tenure (in number of weeks) and work mode (i.e. office or remote)."),(0,r.kt)("p",null,"Now onto the findings! At Spotify, we believe that Backstage improves developer effectiveness, which is a function of satisfaction and productivity. So we set out to quantify what these terms mean in practice for us. For satisfaction, we felt that retention was a good indicator of how a developer\u2019s happiness or satisfaction at a company affects the bottom line. For productivity, we looked at developer output and speed. Lastly, we found what Backstage means for the longevity of a developer\u2019s output.

These efficiencies are what we have been able to confirm at Spotify with the adoption of Backstage throughout the different stages of the development lifecycle; evidenced with the productivity improvements measured in our most recent analysis.
