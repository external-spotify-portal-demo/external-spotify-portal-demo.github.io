We covered future plans for the Spotify Plugins for Backstage bundle and introduced new areas we\u2019re investing to drive more value for Backstage adopters. [Watch the webinar recording here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-pVOwbgfI0). \\n\\nToday, the Spotify team working on Backstage held our first-ever Spotify for Backstage roadmap webinar. We\u2019ll be hosting these events on a regular basis to ensure we\u2019re building in the open to share our learnings, upcoming new features, and a look ahead toward Spotify\u2019s continued investment in Backstage. \\n\\nThe bottom line? Spotify is committed to delivering more value to Backstage adopters faster. In addition to improvements to the [Spotify Plugins for Backstage](https://backstage.spotify.com/plugins/) bundle we launched in open beta last December, we plan to address barriers to adoption, build more Spotify opinionation into our new features, and make our products easier to use. \\n\\n\\n### **The plugin bundle gets a glow up (and release notes!)**\\n\\nFirst, a little history: The [Spotify Plugins for Backstage](https://backstage.spotify.com/plugins/) is a paid subscription available to all Backstage adopters. The bundle subscription includes five plugins designed to address different aspects of developer experience and engineering culture. \\n\\nSome of these plugins ([Soundcheck](https://backstage.spotify.com/plugins/soundcheck/), [Skill Exchange](https://backstage.spotify.com/plugins/skill-exchange/), and [Pulse](https://backstage.spotify.com/plugins/pulse/)) are external versions of some of the most popular homegrown plugins we\u2019ve relied on for years at Spotify \u2014\xa0with thousands of Spotifiers using them daily. \\n\\nOthers are new plugins ([Role-Based Access Control](https://backstage.spotify.com/plugins/rbac/) and [Insights](https://backstage.spotify.com/plugins/insights/)) we created specifically to address enterprise needs and make Backstage more powerful and easier to adopt. \\n\\nSince we launched the bundle, we\u2019ve been floored by the level of interest in the plugins. We\u2019ve spoken with hundreds of companies across various stages of Backstage adoption and have spent these last five months quickly shipping enhancements and highly requested new features. \\n\\nWe also launched a new [Release Notes page](https://backstage.spotify.com/release-notes/) on our website earlier today, so that you can stay up-to-date with the latest releases for the plugin bundle. \\n\\nNow, let\u2019s get to the highlight reel!\\n\\n\\n#### A deep dive on Soundcheck \\n\\nWe don\u2019t play favorites, but we\u2019ve seen a huge amount of interest in Soundcheck and, frankly, we\u2019re not surprised. Soundcheck fundamentally changed our tech health ecosystem at Spotify. We went from using spreadsheets to monitor the quality and reliability of 30,000+ components \ud83d\ude35\u200d\ud83d\udcab to incentivizing code alignment to our engineering best practices in real time \ud83d\udcaa. \\n\\nSince the beta launch, we\u2019ve met with a lot of folks looking to leverage features like scorecards and health checks to create actionable feedback loops. In particular, we\u2019ve heard your requests for third-party tool integrations, the ability for adopters to extend and make API calls to other tools, and your feedback that there is a high barrier to entry for organizations that may not have these types of frameworks already in place.\\n\\nWe are proud to say that we\u2019ve listened to that feedback and, as of our March release, Soundcheck now comes with the [fact framework](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@spotify/backstage-plugin-soundcheck-backend#fact-framework) and an initial set of [third-party integrations](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@spotify/backstage-plugin-soundcheck-backend#third-party-integrations). \\n\\nWith fact framework, customers no longer have to manually push check results to Soundcheck to make a check go from red to green. Instead, Soundcheck evaluates facts against rules you specify and submit results on your behalf. \\n\\nFor third-party integrations, customers can now integrate Soundcheck with source control management (SCM), Github, Bitbucket, Gerrit, and Gitlab. \\n\\nIn the future, the Soundcheck team Spotify will be working on delivering:\\n\\n\\n\\n* No-code UI: Write checks and programs without code. \\n* Aggregations and Reporting: View, export, and understand how teams and components are doing compared to established best practices. \\n* Visualizations and Alerts:  Monitor trends, graphs and historical views, and receive notifications when levels change.\\n* Lastly, waaaaay more third-party integrations: Expect to see more third-party integrations like Snyk, Sonarqube, and Argo CD, and more!\\n\\n\\n#### And more to come for the rest\\n\\nLike we said, we love our plugins equally \u2764\ufe0f, and our plugin delivery teams have been busy making updates and planning new releases for RBAC, Skill Exchange, Pulse, and Insights. \\n\\nWe\u2019ve made notable improvements to RBAC and Skill Exchange based on initial customer feedback. **RBAC** has received a whole slew of new features since launch, including import/export, policy diffing, locally saved drafts, default policy configuration, and integration with Backstage software templates. \\n\\nFor **Skill Exchange,** we\u2019ve migrated the plugin off the Docker backend service, which improves the installation and maintenance experience for adopters. We also added Slack integration, allowing users and owners to receive alerts of Skill Exchange posts using Slack. \\n\\nAnd there\u2019s more to come, including:\\n\\n\\n\\n* **RBAC** accessibility and policy testing\\n* Activity recommendation based on a user\u2019s skill profile and high-priority activity labeling (such as company-wide initiatives) in **Skill Exchange**\\n* Extended question sets, free text responses, and industry benchmarking for **Pulse**\\n* And we\u2019re turning **Insights** into a full-fledged plugin (results currently populate to a dashboard on backstage.spotify.com) with adoption reports and deeper insights!\\n\\n\\n### Going beyond the bundle \\n\\nThe Spotify team is really excited about where the plugin bundle is going, and we\u2019re equally pumped about the areas we\u2019re investing in to remove barriers to Backstage adoption and make it easier to securely extend Backstage.  \\n\\nOne area we\u2019re excited to explore is professional services, where we\u2019ll be looking to offer more hands-on support to a small group of customers. \\n\\nWe also will continue our contributions to evolve the core platform alongside the community. Most notably, we\u2019re investing in improvements to the Software Catalog to make it easier to get up-and-running, and are evaluating opportunities to improve performance of the Catalog. \\n\\nLastly, accessibility is at the heart of what we believe here at Spotify, and we\u2019re committed to continuing to make the Backstage project inclusive to all. By Q3 2023, we\u2019re seeking to bring the plugin bundle and the open source core components into compliance with [Section 508](https://www.section508.gov/) requirements of the U.S. government.\\n\\nOur work to bring more of Spotiy\u2019s expertise and maturity to the Backstage ecosystem has shown us we can build compelling solutions to problems that all organizations face \u2013 like scaling successfully, navigating complexity, and empowering teams. \\n\\nWith that in mind, we\u2019re introducing two new exciting products that the Backstage community can expect to learn more about in the next few months\ud83d\ude80. \\n\\n\\n#### Quickstart for Backstage \\n\\nWe recently celebrated Backstage hitting an important milestone with more than 1,000 companies around the world leveraging the project. But we also hear feedback that Backstage can be tough to get started with. \\n\\nOur answer: **Spotify Quickstart for Backstage \u23e9**. We\u2019re building  a Quickstart product that will enable adopters to get up and running much faster by removing the need to stand up and maintain a codebase in order to adopt Backstage.\\n\\nAdopters that use Quickstart will benefit from dramatically reduced cost of maintenance, by reducing the need to make code changes or redeploy. Quickstart will sit alongside the open source platform and will offer Backstage admins an opinionated starting point. \\n\\nOur aim is that Quickstart makes it easier than ever for adopters to get started with Backstage, so that you can focus on extending your Backstage instance where you have unique needs.  \\n\\n\\n#### Marketplace for Backstage \\n\\nIn addition to Quickstart, we\u2019ve been looking to better understand how adopters find and validate plugins to add to their Backstage instance. \\n\\nWhat we\u2019ve learned is that \u2014 while the open source plugin ecosystem is very rich and continues to grow \u2014\xa0 there\u2019s no easy way of understanding which of the 100+ open source plugins are actively maintained, secure, and validated. It\u2019s also difficult to find the right options when your needs evolve and may not be supported by open source offerings alone. \\n\\nOur goal is to make it easy to find what you need throughout your experience using Backstage, and we want to make it easier than ever to add new capabilities. So we\u2019re investing in a **Spotify Marketplace for Backstage** that will provide a trusted set of resources to help as your organization\u2019s needs evolve \ud83e\udd1d. \\n\\nThe Marketplace will contain solutions from Spotify and trusted third-party partners. All of the capabilities available within our Marketplace will work seamlessly with Quickstart, and will enable users to easily enable add-ons with a few clicks. \\n\\n\\n## Book a demo to learn more\\n\\nWe are really excited to share more about these two key features from Spotify. Stay tuned in the next coming months for more details!\\n\\nIf you\u2019re itching to (re)watch the webinar, take a look at the [video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-pVOwbgfI0). \\n\\nIf you\u2019re excited about the bundle and want to see the plugins in action, [attend a demo](https://backstage.spotify.com/contact-us/demo/)."},{"id":"/spotify-roadmap-for-backstage-announcement","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/spotify-roadmap-for-backstage-announcement","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/spotify-roadmap-for-backstage-announcement/index.md","source":"@site/blog/spotify-roadmap-for-backstage-announcement/index.md","title":"What\u2019s next for Backstage and the Spotify plugin bundle","description":"The Spotify team is launching a commercial Roadmap Webinar series beginning in May.

We\u2019ve been busy since launching the Spotify Plugins for Backstage bundle subscription in December, and we\u2019re excited to share what we\u2019re building next for Backstage and the bundle. [Sign up for our commercial roadmap webinar on May 9.](https://info.backstage.spotify.com/roadmap)\\n\\n## Since we last spoke\\n\\nIt\u2019s been a busy few months since we launched [Spotify Plugins for Backstage](https://backstage.spotify.com/plugins/) into public beta back in December. Since then, we\u2019ve been busy welcoming new customers and improving the bundle based on the feedback we\u2019re hearing from you. We\u2019ve learned a lot and are in active development on more than a few exciting products. We can\u2019t wait to share them with you soon!\\n\\nWe\u2019re excited to highlight some recent updates for our [Soundcheck](https://backstage.spotify.com/plugins/soundcheck/) plugin in particular. Since launch, we\u2019ve released two new features aimed at making it easier to get up and running with the plugin while also improving your ability to take action on the valuable insights the plugin provides. Most notably, we recently released a [Fact Framework](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@spotify/backstage-plugin-soundcheck-backend#fact-framework) and [third-party integrations](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@spotify/backstage-plugin-soundcheck-backend#third-party-integrations). The Fact Framework allows Soundcheck to collect facts (un-opinionated information) about an entity in the software catalog. Facts are made available to Soundcheck through fact collectors. For example, the GitHub fact collector extracts one or more facts about GitHub projects/repositories. Soundcheck can also be extended by registering additional fact collectors. This enables adopters to extend Soundcheck in ways relevant to their organization, systems and infrastructure.\\n\\nTogether, these two features provide a clearer onramp to navigate checks using best practices (tested and proven at Spotify). Additionally, these new releases will make it easier to expand your programs over time through a growing library of out-of-the-box integrations with first and third-party tools, like the Backstage Software Catalog, GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, and Gerrit.\\n\\n## What we\u2019ve learned\\n\\nIn addition to the improvements we\u2019re making to the plugins themselves, we\u2019re also excited to share some customer insights from the past few months.\\n\\n- **The Spotify plugins help companies adopt Backstage successfully:** We\u2019ve really enjoyed speaking with current and prospective Backstage adopters around the world on how these plugins can help advance their developer experience goals. We\u2019re seeing incredible interest for the plugin bundle across all industries, organization sizes, and levels of maturity with Backstage. In many cases with companies early in their Backstage journey, we\u2019re hearing that Spotify\'s plugins are integral to moving forward with adoption.\\n- **We have an opportunity to provide deeper opinionation:** We\u2019re excited to hear partners asking for more guidance from Spotify as it pertains to both Backstage and the plugin bundle. We\u2019re working to establish stronger signaling within the products and through documentation to make it easier to onboard, leverage best practices, and reduce time-to-value.\\n- **People want more visibility into their Backstage usage:** Customers struggle to understand what users are doing in their Backstage instance and are seeking better tools to measure and monitor, particularly during key adoption phases (for example, encouraging developers to use Backstage frequently and consistently within their organization). We\u2019re excited for the role the [Insights](https://backstage.spotify.com/plugins/insights/) plugin is playing here, and looking forward to sharing more features for Insights soon.\\n\\n## What\u2019s next from Spotify\\n\\nAnd we\u2019re just getting started! [You are invited to join our very first Roadmap Webinar](https://info.backstage.spotify.com/roadmap) on May 9 at 10:00 am EST to hear more about the next steps for Spotify Plugins for Backstage and our commercial offerings.

Backstage Search Platform is a search experience built for you, by you. \\n\\nThe Backstage Search Platform makes it possible for you to search across your entire software ecosystem. With a Search platform that is customizable and extendable, you can identify your needs within your organization and set up search to solve these problems. Whether it is to search through the Software Catalog or technical documentation generated by the TechDocs plugin. \\n\\n\\n\\n### So what is Backstage Search 1.0?\\n\\nSince the first release of the Backstage Search Platform, we have seen a fantastic community grow around the search plugins. To mention just a few of these contributions: \\n* More search engine modules: [Elasticsearch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@backstage/plugin-search-backend-module-elasticsearch) originally [contributed](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/pull/6569) by Roadie and [Postgres](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@backstage/plugin-search-backend-module-pg) originally [contributed](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/pull/7316) by SDA SE\\n* More components: Quick search modal, originally [contributed](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/pull/7316) by Expedia Group\\n* More plugin integrations: TechDocs also [contributed](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/pull/6375) by Roadie and [Software Catalog](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/pull/4515) \\n\\nThese are just a few contributions of the countless enhancements and improvements made by contributors across the globe. With a well adopted and tested search platform we feel confident to release Backstage Search as 1.0. \\n\\nPackages included in Backstage Search 1.0 release are:\\n\\n**Core search packages**\\n\\n* [@backstage/plugin-search](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@backstage/plugin-search)   \\n* [@backstage/plugin-search-react  ](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@backstage/plugin-search-react)  \\n* [@backstage/plugin-search-common](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@backstage/plugin-search-common)\\n* [@backstage/plugin-search-backend](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@backstage/plugin-search-backend)     \\n* [@backstage/plugin-search-backend-node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@backstage/plugin-search-backend-node)\\n\\n**Modules**\\n\\n* [@backstage/plugin-search-backend-module-elasticsearch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@backstage/plugin-search-backend-module-elasticsearch)\\n\\nNo additional features are released as part of the major release as the maintainers of the search packages focused on the following for this release: \\n\\n* Bug fixes and clean up of deprecations.\\n* Improved error handling for missing indices. \\n* Separation of AWS Elastic and Open Elastic support.\\n* Refactor the packages by moving reusable components from `@backstage/plugin-search` to `@backstage/plugin-search-react`.\\n* Improved documentation including tutorials for how to [Integrate Search into a plugin](https://backstage.io/docs/plugins/integrating-search-into-plugins).\\n\\nYou might have noticed that the [@backstage/plugin-search-backend-module-pg](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@backstage/plugin-search-backend-module-pg) package is not part of 1.0. That\u2019s because that package is a community supported module, and therefore we have not included it as part of 1.0. If you are interested in pushing the Postgres engine to 1.0, feel free to reach out to us in the [#search](https://discord.com/channels/687207715902193673/770283289327566848) channel on Discord.\\n\\n\\n### Elasticsearch as the recommended engine for production usage\\n\\nWhen the Backstage Search Platform was first released, it came with an in-memory search engine as default - Lunr. While this is a good engine to use on a smaller scale and for local development (to avoid having to set up a search engine instance separately), it also has its limitations such as: \\n\\n* Lunr does not scale well. Horizontally scaled deployments of Backstage and/or Backstage Search backend using Lunr result in either duplicated indexing processes and indices or inconsistent index state across nodes.\\n* Lunr\u2019s filter functionality is limited, especially for [logical AND/OR operators](https://github.com/olivernn/lunr.js/issues/353).\\n* Lunr has a smaller community than Elasticsearch, which could mean that adopters relying on it will have less by way of resources for iterating on and improving search. \\n\\nTherefore, we recommend using Elasticsearch for production usage.  Moving forward, the search maintainers will prioritize the Elasticsearch engine and the community will maintain the Postgres engine. \\n\\n\\n### How to contribute\\n\\nIf you want to contribute and to further improve search, you can check out the [open issues labeled with search](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/issues?q=is%3Aissue+search+label%3Asearch+is%3Aopen) or reach out to us at the [#search](https://discord.com/channels/687207715902193673/770283289327566848) Discord channel.\\n\\n\\n### How to get started\\n\\nIf you haven\u2019t adopted the Backstage Search Platform yet and feel like now is a good time.

We continue to focus on improving the stability and scalability of Backstage while enhancing its functionality. Thanks to focused efforts from the TechDocs core team and community, we\'re happy to say that TechDocs \u2014 [our docs-like-code solution](https://backstage.io/blog/2020/09/08/announcing-tech-docs) for all the software in your catalog \u2014 is now, after [Software Templates](https://backstage.io/blog/2021/07/26/software-templates-are-now-in-beta), the second core feature to graduate to beta.\\n\\nIn addition to new features and improvements, we made numerous compatibility updates ahead of this feature release. You\'ll find support for a variety of CI systems, cloud storage solutions, and source control systems \u2014 so that TechDocs works for most orgs, right out of box. But there\'s much more to explore in this beta, thanks to contributions from the community.\\n\\nWhen we set out to define what beta looked like, we combed through GitHub issues, Discord discussions, and other media to identify common pain points and challenges encountered by those around the world who consume and author TechDocs documentation in their organization\'s Backstage instance. Based on this research, we put together a user-focused milestone and got to work. For an issue-by-issue breakdown, check out the milestone [on GitHub](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/milestone/29?closed=1) \u2014 or, just read on to get the highlights.\\n\\n## Real-time builds and feedback\\n\\n![Click the refresh button to hot-reload the updated content](refresh-button.gif)\\n\\nTechDocs can be transformational once fully up and running (update your code and your docs with the same pull request!). But for first-time users and especially those unfamiliar with the MkDocs ecosystem upon which TechDocs is built, there are often many small, obtuse hurdles that can get in the way of success. Leading up to the beta release, we worked to surface and improve relevant errors and other details during the documentation generation process. Better still, all of this detail is now provided to users _in real-time_, as docs are generated and refreshed.\\n\\n\ud83d\ude4c Shout out to Dominik Henneke for implementing the interactive experience.\\n\\n## Custom homepages: Make TechDocs yours\\n\\n![TechDocs custom homepage](techdocs-custom-homepage.png)\\n\\nWe strive to make it so that you can mold Backstage into the shape that best fits your organization. With this beta release, just as you can with the Catalog entities and [Search](https://backstage.io/blog/2021/06/24/announcing-backstage-search-platform#composable-search-page-experiences), you can now customize and compose your own TechDocs homepage. Use it to level up the front page of your Backstage documentation by highlighting golden documentation at your company, or use the new and improved (and Catalog-inspired) experience. Read more about [how to customize the TechDocs homepage](https://backstage.io/docs/features/techdocs/how-to-guides#how-to-customize-the-techdocs-home-page).\\n\\n\ud83d\ude4f Thanks to Phil Kuang for the improved default TechDocs home experience\\n\\n## Simpler YAML annotations: What\'s in a ref?\\n\\n![A simpler techdocs-ref annotation value](techdocs-ref.png)\\n\\nWe often forget that in order to enable TechDocs on a Catalog entity, documentation authors have to sprinkle a little ref annotation voodoo into their catalog-info.yaml file. The form of this magic \u2014 the `backstage.io/techdocs-ref` annotation \u2014 has evolved over TechDocs\' life. But unless you\'re a real Backstage aficionado, the specifics of what the value meant and how to construct it could be somewhat of a mystery.\\n\\nIn the beta, we\'ve simplified this annotation dramatically for documentation authors, aligning its value with TechDocs\' docs-like-code philosophy itself. In the vast majority of cases, its value will simply be `dir:.` \u2014 which means this catalog entity contains documentation and the mkdocs.yml file describing this documentation lives in the current directory. We continue to support edge cases for [other techdocs-ref annotation values](https://backstage.io/docs/features/techdocs/how-to-guides#how-to-understand-techdocs-ref-annotation-values), as well.\\n\\n\ud83d\udc4f Another round of applause for Dominik for driving this improvement through.\\n\\n## Everything neat and tidy\\n\\nIf you\'ve ever twitched a little looking at the address bar as you navigated through your TechDocs, because the \\"C\\" in \\"Component\\" was capitalized, or cringed whilst perusing through your TechDocs storage bucket, only to see assets you definitely remember deleting from a documentation site cluttering up the place\u2026twitch and cringe no more!\\n\\nTechDocs base paths are now case-insensitive, stale files are automatically cleaned up by the TechDocs publishing process \u2014 and even though [I say _.yaml_ and you say _.yml_](https://open.spotify.com/track/6NDaYWg85ZnJ3Ae0WkILWh) \u2014 TechDocs will now happily accept either file extension for your MkDocs YAML file.\\n\\n## What should I do to upgrade?\\n\\nIf you\'ve been waiting for the beta to give TechDocs a shot, good news! You\'ll get all of the above, plus all of TechDocs\' existing features, right out of the box. Newly created Backstage apps come ready-to-go. You\'ll know you\'re on beta if you\'re using the following versions:\\n\\n- TechDocs Plugin version >= 0.11.0\\n- TechDocs Backend Plugin version >= 0.10.0\\n- TechDocs CLI version >= 0.7.0\\n\\nIf you\'re upgrading from a prior, alpha version of TechDocs, be aware that there are some breaking changes that you will need to account for. Most importantly:\\n\\n- Be sure your app\'s instance of TechDocs is wired up to use the composability API. [See full routing instructions here](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/packages/create-app/CHANGELOG.md#0338).\\n- If you\'ve configured TechDocs to publish generated content to a remote storage solution provider like AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Azure Blob Storage, you will need to use the TechDocs CLI to migrate the contents of your storage bucket. [See full migration instructions here](https://backstage.io/docs/features/techdocs/how-to-guides#how-to-migrate-from-techdocs-alpha-to-beta).\\n- In order to take advantage of the stale file deletion functionality, you may need to add some permissions to the account or role used by your TechDocs backend to publish contents to your storage provider. [See \\"Using Cloud Storage docs\\"](https://backstage.io/docs/features/techdocs/using-cloud-storage) for updated permissions recommendations.\\n\\nThanks again to the whole community for hitting this milestone with us!

Throughout the year, we\u2019ve been focussed on improving the stability and scalability of these areas while enhancing the feature sets based upon requests from the community. Software Templates \u2014 which enable push-button deployments with all your standards and best practices built-in \u2014 is our first feature-complete release candidate to graduate to beta. Read on to learn how this release improves template customization and flexibility, as well as performance.\\n\\nLet\u2019s rewind a little bit, around a year in fact. Backstage had been open sourced, and we released our first version of Software Templates and our Scaffolder plugin.\\n\\nIn case you missed it, [Software Templates](https://backstage.io/blog/2020/08/05/announcing-backstage-software-templates) are part of the Create feature set, where you can set up Backstage to give your engineers the ability to spin up a new microservice, website, or any other software component with your organization\u2019s best practices built-in, right from the start.\\n\\nBack when we released the first version of these templates, with the `apiVersion` `backstage.io/v1alpha1`, they were a little restrictive in what they could do. The generated repository could only have one template source and it was restricted to only being [cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) templates. And it had to fit into the three stages of templating which was `Prepare`, `Template`, and `Publish`.\\n\\nWe [opened up for feedback](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/issues/2771) from the community knowing that this wasn\u2019t going to be the final version, but something of a stepping stone to where we want to be in the future.\\n\\nAnd now we come to today\u2026\\n\\n## Anddddd\u2026 Action(s)! \ud83c\udfac\\n\\nFollowing the removal of the previously deprecated `backstage.io/v1alpha1` templates, today we\u2019re officially announcing the beta version of Software Templates, or `backstage.io/v1beta2`.\\n\\nWith it comes an entirely new architecture to the Software Templates functionality, and a load of new exciting features, which I\u2019ll dig into a little deeper.\\n\\n### Template actions\\n\\nWe\u2019ve totally opened up the ability to compose your own workflows for each Template that you have registered in Software Templates. This means no restrictions on where your template skeleton is kept, and no restrictions on what your workflow should look like.\\n\\nTemplate Actions are customizable JavaScript functions that allow you to extend the capabilities of the Software Templates by adding your own business logic or reusing some of our Built-In actions.\\n\\n![New template syntax with actions](example-template-code.png \'An example of the new template syntax with steps and parameters\')\\n\\nThe workflow for Software Templates are now step-based, and each Software Template can have a customizable amount of steps which will in turn call these new actions.\\n\\n![New steps being rendered in the frontend](steps-running.gif \'An example of a Template with customizable steps\')\\n\\nThese actions are very heavily inspired by GitHub Actions and GitHub Workflows, and we\u2019ve given back a lot of control to the template authors so they can build the boilerplate and push the code however they want.\\n\\n### Custom UI extensions\\n\\nA large part of the Software Templates feature is the form that we use to collect user input which is then passed on to these new actions. Sometimes, it makes sense that Template Authors want to provide their own React components which can be rendered in the frontend to maybe do some more complex things like calling internal APIs to provide autocomplete.\\n\\nThis is now possible with the new `ScaffolderFieldExtensions`.\\n\\n![Custom UI extensions](custom-components.gif \'An example of `ScaffolderFieldExtension` is the `OwnerPicker` component which can automatically add options and suggest typeahead with data from an async API request\')\\n\\nTemplate Authors can create their own components to provide data to the custom actions in any way you see fit, and even override our own built in ones too like the `RepoUrlPicker`.\\n\\n### Horizontal scalability\\n\\nThe Scaffolder Service and Software Templates are now horizontally scalable, coordinating work between your deployed backend machines. This means now that the number of instances of the `@backstage/plugin-scaffolder-backend` plugin you have, is the same amount of jobs that you can have in parallel. This ensures that your tasks are handled quickly and reliably, while providing great feedback in the process.\\n\\n## Try out the new templates\\n\\nWe\u2019re still on the journey to making the Software Templates a great user experience for both authors and developers \u2014 but we\u2019re not done yet, so watch this space for new exciting features to come!\\n\\nIn the meantime, make sure to visit the documentation for [building templates](https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-templates/adding-templates) or creating your own [custom actions](https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-templates/writing-custom-actions)."},{"id":"/product-updates/roadmap-q3-2021","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/product-updates/roadmap-q3-2021","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/product-updates/roadmap-q3-2021/index.md","source":"@site/blog/product-updates/roadmap-q3-2021/index.md","title":"Product roadmap: Q3 2021","description":"See what features and improvements are being prioritized this quarter (and beyond).","date":"2023-07-13T12:03:53.442Z","formattedDate":"July 13, 2023","tags":[],"readingTime":0.615,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Francesco Corti, Spotify"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Product roadmap: Q3 2021","description":"See what features and improvements are being prioritized this quarter (and beyond).","author":"Francesco Corti, Spotify","publishedISODate":"2021-08-12","previewImage":"preview.png"},"prevItem":{"title":"Software Templates now in Beta","permalink":"/blog/product-updates/software-templates-are-now-in-beta"},"nextItem":{"title":"The Backstage Search platform: a customizable search tool built just for you","permalink":"/blog/product-updates/announcing-backstage-search-platform"}},"content":"![Backstage roadmap for Q3 2021](hero.png)\\n\\nIt\u2019s here!

A total rethinking of the core search feature in Backstage, it\u2019s more than just a box you type into \u2014 it\u2019s a mini platform all by itself. With its composable frontend and extensible backend, you can design and build the search tool that suits your organization\u2019s needs.\\n\\nSo, you don\u2019t just get an improved out-of-the-box experience for searching whatever is in your software catalog. You can also add support for searching other sources, too. Customize it the way you want and you can search your catalog, your plugins and docs \u2014 and even external sources, like Stack Overflow and Confluence \u2014 all at once, all right inside Backstage.\\n\\nWith one query, your teams can find exactly what they\u2019re looking for: anything and everything.\\n\\n## Search and explore\\n\\nBeing able to easily explore your ecosystem \u2014 to discover software, tools, documentation, and other valuable knowledge \u2014 is one of [the three main jobs of Backstage](https://backstage.io/blog/2021/05/20/adopting-backstage#three-jobs-create-manage-explore). Teams should be able to find what other teams have already built, so they can reuse and contribute to components instead of unknowingly duplicating them. Data endpoints should be shared, not siloed away. Services and their APIs should be easily discoverable. Best practices and technical documentation should be easily found.\\n\\nAlong with the [Backstage Service Catalog](https://backstage.io/blog/2020/06/22/backstage-service-catalog-alpha), Backstage Search is essential to enabling this discoverability \u2014 allowing new hires and old hands alike to explore your infrastructure instead of getting lost inside it.\\n\\nWe also quickly realized that search looks different from organization to organization. Therefore, we built a search platform that lets you plug in your own search engine, index any information you like, or build a customized search page experience that fits your users\u2019 needs.\\n\\nSince finding what you are looking for in Backstage is critical for success, we started by identifying the needs and goals of search.\\n\\n## Rethinking search, inside and out\\n\\nSpotify\u2019s internal version of Backstage has had some of the features of Backstage Search for a while, and open sourcing them has been top of mind since day one. But we didn\u2019t want to just port our internal version to the open source version. We wanted to take the opportunity to apply what we\u2019ve learned inside Spotify over the last year, address the needs we\u2019ve observed in the community, and ultimately open source not just a search feature but a search platform. We started the process by looking at the [jobs to be done](https://hbr.org/2016/09/know-your-customers-jobs-to-be-done).\\n\\n![Backstage Search platform](jobs-to-be-done.png \'A high-level overview of the process, identifying all the jobs of search.\')\\n\\nFirst, we looked at which jobs to be done belonged to the search plugin itself (e.g., \u201ccollect documents to index\u201d) and which belonged to the other plugins (e.g., \u201cformat documents for indexing\u201d), and then whether those jobs belonged to the frontend (\u201cdisplay results\u201d) or the backend (\u201cschedule indexing\u201d).\\n\\nLooking at all these various jobs, we defined four goals for the platform:\\n\\n- **Flexibility:** Be search engine\u2013agnostic\\n- **Simplicity:** Make it easy for content owners to make their content searchable/discoverable\\n- **Control:** Allow plugin developers to customize their search results components\\n- **Reusability:** Offer reusable components/APIs that other devs can leverage\\n\\nBeginning our journey this way \u2014 by identifying the jobs to be done first, then defining the product goals from there \u2014 we could make sure that the search platform addressed real needs and improved the search experience for both users and plugin developers.\\n\\nThis approach not only created a better search tool for the open source community, but for Spotify, as well. So, instead of just open sourcing our internal version of search, we ended up with an even better solution \u2014 one that we can all use and build on together, both inside and outside Spotify.\\n\\n## Say hello to the Backstage Search platform\\n\\n![Backstage Search platform](search-results.png)\\n\\nWe are now happy and proud to announce our alpha version of the [Backstage Search Platform](https://backstage.io/docs/features/search/architecture), featuring:\\n\\n- Bring your own search engine (Flexibility)\\n- Collators for easily indexing content from plugins and other sources (Simplicity)\\n- Composable search page experiences (Control, Reusability)\\n- Customize the look and feel of each search result (Control, Reusability)\\n\\n### Bring your own search engine\\n\\nBy introducing a Search Integration Layer, we have been able to keep the query translation of the search term and filters close to the search engine itself. This makes our search backend less focused on how a set of terms and filters should be translated to fit a certain search engine interface and more focused on querying and retrieving results as well as collecting results to index.\\n\\nWith the Search Integration Layer, your organization can bring your search engine of choice to Backstage \u2014 instead of relying on Backstage to support a specific search engine that might not fit the needs of your organization, either today or in the future.\\n\\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean \u201cbatteries not included\u201d. The current version of Backstage Search ships with Lunr support built-in \u2014 and support for ElasticSearch is not very far off. And we hope the number of supported search engines will continue to grow with the community\u2019s help.\\n\\n### Collators for easily indexing content from plugins and other sources\\n\\nSince Backstage\u2019s functionality comes from its plugins, we wanted the process of making plugin content searchable to be as frictionless as possible. Therefore we decided on a concept we call collators. Collators are responsible for collecting documents to index from a plugin. Your collators live inside your own plugin, but are registered in the Backstage app\u2019s search backend.\\n\\nCollators can also be used to index external sources, like Stack Overflow and Confluence. You can watch a demo of how easy it is to extend search with collators [here](https://youtu.be/Z78FFaObTfk?t=339).\\n\\n### Composable search page experiences\\n\\nEvery engineering org has different needs \u2014 that is something we have definitely learned over the last year. Your software catalog might be set up differently than ours and therefore your needs for how search results look and how the search filters work will also differ.\\n\\nThat\'s why we have put effort into making your search page experience composable to your organization\'s needs. What do we mean by that? When you adopt Backstage and set up your app, you can set up \u2014 or, compose \u2014 your search page by using existing components or by creating your own custom ones.\\n\\n### Customize the look and feel of each search result\\n\\nA good example of the level of customization the platform allows is how list items are displayed in search results. A search result component can be a list, this list can consist of different list items (search results returned from the search engine) \u2014 but these list items could look different depending on what the search result returns in terms of its fields.\\n\\nLet\u2019s say that for an entity returned from the software catalog maybe the most important information to show is the name, while a result returned from the TechDocs plugin should maybe show the text content as the most important information. This can be customized by creating <CustomResultListItem /> components (like TechDocsResultListItem or CatalogResultListItem or whatever list item component you want) and configuring them in the app.\\n\\nIf there is no need to customize your search result list items, the <DefaultResultListItem /> component is there for you to reuse.\\n\\n## Getting started with Backstage Search\\n\\nWe put together [a getting started guide](https://backstage.io/docs/features/search/getting-started) that provides two different ways to set up Backstage Search:\\n\\n- Create a new app and get the most out of the search setup right out of the box, or\\n- Add the new Backstage Search setup to your existing Backstage app.\\n\\nWhichever situation you\u2019re in, we have you covered.\\n\\n## What\u2019s next?\\n\\nWe\u2019ve built the foundation for the Backstage Search platform, and we can\'t wait to see the exciting engines, collators, and components the community builds on the platform.\\n\\nYou can check out our [project roadmap](https://backstage.io/docs/features/search/search-overview#project-roadmap) in our search documentation or track the progress of our [Beta milestone](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/milestone/27) and [GA milestone](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/milestone/28).\\n\\nFor any questions, feedback or ideas about the Backstage Search platform, join us in the #search channel on [Discord](https://discord.gg/backstage-687207715902193673)!"},{"id":"/paid-plugins-announcement","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/paid-plugins-announcement","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/paid-plugins-announcement/index.md","source":"@site/blog/paid-plugins-announcement/index.md","title":"Coming next year from Spotify: paid plugins for Backstage","description":"In addition to the open source plugins that we\u2019ll continue to release for Backstage, we\u2019re going to begin offering Spotify-built paid plugins.","date":"2023-07-13T12:03:53.422Z","formattedDate":"July 13, 2023","tags":[],"readingTime":3.22,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Austin Lamon, Spotify"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Coming next year from Spotify: paid plugins for Backstage","description":"In addition to the open source plugins that we\u2019ll continue to release for Backstage, we\u2019re going to begin offering Spotify-built paid plugins.","author":"Austin Lamon, Spotify","publishedISODate":"2021-11-17","previewImage":"./preview.png"},"prevItem":{"title":"The Backstage Search platform: a customizable search tool built just for you","permalink":"/blog/product-updates/announcing-backstage-search-platform"},"nextItem":{"title":"Now Available: Spotify Plugins for Backstage","permalink":"/blog/now-available-spotify-plugins-for-backstage"}},"content":"![New Spotify plugins coming next year](spotify-paid-plugins.png)\\n\\n**TLDR:** Next year, Spotify is going to start selling some new plugins we build for Backstage.

We want to make Backstage the standard developer portal platform across the industry to help developers everywhere be happier and more effective.\\n\\nAll along, we\u2019ve believed the best way to achieve that goal is by fostering a thriving ecosystem around the platform. Today we\u2019re excited to share the next step in expanding that ecosystem: starting next year, Spotify will begin offering paid plugins for Backstage. This will allow us to bring even more of our expertise and experience to the platform.\\n\\nWe love Backstage. We depend on Backstage. Right now, only a small portion of the value that Backstage provides within Spotify is available to people outside of Spotify. And as the project has evolved, we\u2019ve heard from adopters and contributors alike that Spotify\u2019s experience and maturity with Backstage is one of the platform\u2019s key differentiators.\\n\\nAdding paid plugins from Spotify to the other commercial services surrounding Backstage will make the platform more valuable to current adopters (Spotify included), broaden its reach to new adopters, and create a more diverse ecosystem for the community at large.\\n\\nAnd revenue generated from paid plugins can be reinvested into developing more plugins and evolving Backstage. And the beat goes on!\\n\\n## Spotify-built, Spotify-tested\\n\\nOver the years, we\u2019ve learned a lot about how to improve developer experience with Backstage \u2014 and we can\u2019t wait to bring even more of those ideas and insights to your teams.\\n\\nThis new category of plugins \u2014 built and sold by Spotify \u2014 will come in two flavors:\\n\\n1. **Tried and true:** Beloved plugins we\u2019ve been using internally with great success and have been battle-tested by our own internal developer community.\\n2. **New and improved:** Brand-new plugin concepts that we think will unlock value for engineering orgs adopting Backstage.\\n\\nWhile Spotify will retain ownership and licensing of these plugins, there\u2019s no doubt that we also plan to keep contributing open source plugins to the community. We want to keep the momentum on the open source project, while also adding rocket fuel by unlocking more plugin possibilities.\\n\\n## More paid plugins, more free plugins \u2014 more value for everyone\\n\\nIf this business model sounds familiar (hello Freemium!), that\u2019s because it\'s a core part of our company mission: to unlock the human potential and creativity out there in the world. We believe developers need a better experience, just like everyone should enjoy music and audio in the ways they want to listen.\\n\\nOur intention is to keep adding new plugins to our commercial offering over time. But to be clear \u2014 SPOTIFY IS NOT MOVING AWAY FROM OPEN SOURCE CONTRIBUTIONS OR THE BACKSTAGE COMMUNITY. Sorry for getting shouty, but we really don\u2019t want the community we love to get the wrong idea. In fact, it\u2019s really the opposite.\\n\\nWe\u2019re doubling down on Backstage, and paid plugins enable Spotify to continue to grow our investment in the open source project and community.\\n\\n## Coming soon to a repo near you \u2014 sign up now\\n\\nWe\u2019ll be talking through our commercialization plan a bit more at this week\u2019s [Backstage Community Session][issue].

We\u2019re delighted to offer a bundle that encapsulates the plugins needed to level up your Backstage developer portal. You can [watch our launch event](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLf1KFlSkDLIA2n67Fk87svXvTi2vczEXT) or just [get started with our plugins](https://backstage.spotify.com/contact-us/demo).\\n\\nWe\u2019re delighted to share that our [Spotify Plugins for Backstage bundle subscription](https://backstage.spotify.com/plugins/) is now available in open beta to all Backstage adopters. After years of research and iterating, we\u2019ve created hundreds of Backstage plugins at Spotify, and this bundle of five plugins represents the very best of what we\u2019ve built.\\n\\n### Un(b)locking developer experience\\n\\nAt Spotify, we are obsessed with how to create a better experience for our developers. Our company mission is to unlock human potential and creativity. We\u2019ve said it before and we\u2019ll say it again for the cheap seats in the back: Developers are creators!\\n\\nEvery company is a software company. So every company has to ensure their software developers are able to do their best work. At Spotify, we\u2019ve been on a multi-year journey toward this concept of developer effectiveness, which we believe is a function of two things: productivity and happiness.\\n\\n![developer effectiveness equation](Effectiveness_equation.png)\\n\\nSure, we all want productivity. Now more than ever, we need to figure out how to do more with less. But maybe more importantly, how do you turn the spotlight on the humans in your organization and find out if they\u2019re empowered? If their energy is being applied in healthy ways? And if they have what they need to experiment, try new things, and innovate? That\u2019s developer satisfaction (aka happiness). We want to help you have both.\\n\\nThis focus on developer effectiveness has helped Spotify realize more than 10% year-over-year increases in developer productivity with employee engagement and retention rates well over industry averages. And in the three years since we open sourced the Backstage platform, we\u2019ve spoken with hundreds of companies who are all in pursuit of the same goals.\\n\\nSo if you want developer effectiveness, you\u2019re in the right place. The Spotify Plugins for Backstage bundle is the next step toward Spotify\u2019s goal to share what we\u2019ve learned with the world. We\u2019re confident these plugins will take each and every developer portal built on Backstage to the next level, by making developers in your organization happier and more productive.\\n\\n### Level up your Backstage app\\n\\nDon\u2019t just take it from me: Earlier today, we hosted our [launch event](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLf1KFlSkDLIA2n67Fk87svXvTi2vczEXT) where we heard directly from the Spotify plugin creators and Backstage users. At the launch, we covered how and why we built these plugins, the value they can unlock for you today, and, of course, we demoed the plugins themselves.\\n\\nWe also talked with adopters \u2014 [TELUS](https://www.telusinternational.com/), [Expedia Group](https://www.expediagroup.com/), [Booz Allen Hamilton](https://www.boozallen.com/), and [Bank of the West](https://www.bankofthewest.com/) \u2014 about how they\u2019re addressing their own developer effectiveness goals with the Backstage platform, their experiences with the open source community, and their excitement about the Spotify Plugins for Backstage bundle.\\n\\nBe sure to watch the [replay](https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLf1KFlSkDLIA2n67Fk87svXvTi2vczEXT) below or [read more on our website](https://backstage.spotify.com/plugins).\\n\\n<youtube title=\\"Spotify Plugins for Backstage | Shipping Our Expertise\\" url=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLf1KFlSkDLIA2n67Fk87svXvTi2vczEXT\\">\\n</youtube>\\n\\nAs a refresher \u2014 the Spotify Plugins for Backstage bundle includes five plugins today:\\n\\n- [Soundcheck](https://backstage.spotify.com/plugins/soundcheck): Codify engineering best practices to improve quality, reliability, security, and alignment throughout your software ecosystem, all in a gamified and easy-to-use way.\\n\\n- [Role-Based Access Control](https://backstage.spotify.com/plugins/rbac): Manage access and protect your data in Backstage, flexibly and easily, to meet your organization\u2019s evolving security and compliance needs.\\n\\n- [Skill Exchange](https://backstage.spotify.com/plugins/skill-exchange): Connect your best talent to the highest impact work through an opportunity marketplace intuitively built into Backstage.\\n\\n- [Pulse](https://backstage.spotify.com/plugins/pulse): Find out how your R&D teams really feel.

These plugins have been put through endless hours of internal use, iteration, and improvement. We know they work because they\u2019ve done amazing things for us \u2014 from Soundcheck bringing test flakiness to below 1% to Skill Exchange powering thousands of collaborative hacks between teams.\\n\\nWe\u2019ve also worked with a small group of customers to kick the tires on the external versions to get them they\u2019re ready for primetime. And there\u2019s much more to come! Our goal is to get as much feedback from the Backstage community in this open beta period and figure out how we can drive even more value for Backstage adopters.\\n\\nYou can get started with our plugins today by [contacting us](https://backstage.spotify.com/contact-us/demo) for a demo or pricing conversation."},{"id":"/nerdout-at-spotify-podcast","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/nerdout-at-spotify-podcast","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/nerdout-at-spotify-podcast/index.md","source":"@site/blog/nerdout-at-spotify-podcast/index.md","title":"Listen to the Backstage episodes of the NerdOut@Spotify podcast","description":"Hear the story of Backstage, from inside Spotify to Netflix, American Airlines, and the rest of the open source community.","date":"2023-07-13T12:03:53.385Z","formattedDate":"July 13, 2023","tags":[],"readingTime":2.355,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Jeff Feng, Spotify"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Listen to the Backstage episodes of the NerdOut@Spotify podcast","description":"Hear the story of Backstage, from inside Spotify to Netflix, American Airlines, and the rest of the open source community.","author":"Jeff Feng, Spotify","publishedISODate":"2022-04-28","previewImage":"./preview.png"},"prevItem":{"title":"Now Available: Spotify Plugins for Backstage","permalink":"/blog/now-available-spotify-plugins-for-backstage"},"nextItem":{"title":"How we measure Backstage success at Spotify","permalink":"/blog/measuring-backstage-success-at-spotify"}},"content":"![Backstage on the NerdOut@Spotify podcast](nerdout-at-spotify-podcast-backstage.png)\\n\\nEver wonder how Backstage got its start?

Satisfaction? How do you measure Backstage success?](measuring-success.png)\\n\\nWithin the Backstage community, much of the conversation centers on [strategies for adopting](https://backstage.io/docs/overview/adopting) a developer portal. But, we believe it\u2019s equally important to discuss what to do once you\u2019ve made the decision to adopt Backstage. In essence, how can you gauge whether Backstage is moving the needle on improving software development processes? More importantly, how do you measure improvements to developer experience and developer effectiveness?\\n\\nThe answer \u2014 like most when it comes to Backstage \u2014 is there is no one-size-fits-all approach. So we\u2019ll start with what we know and what we\u2019ve done internally at Spotify. (In our next post, we\u2019ll look at how our friends at Expedia Group go about it.)\\n\\n## Productivity vs efficiency vs effectiveness\\n\\nLet\u2019s start with terminology. This may seem pretty basic, but software development is a human-intensive process. Much of its success hinges on a developer\u2019s _productivity_ and _efficiency_. These terms are often used interchangeably but they are actually different metrics:\\n\\n- **Developer productivity** is the ratio of output (i.e., the quantity of work completed) to input (i.e. effort, time). This metric is easy to measure, but it doesn\u2019t tell the whole story.\\n- **Developer efficiency** is measured by the amount of resources (i.e., time, computation power, human resources) used per unit of best possible output. It accounts for all the input required, so you can see if the team is doing enough of the right kind of work.\\n\\n![Productivity = size of developed software/software development effort. Efficiency = size of developed software/resources used.](productivity-vs-efficiency.png)\\n\\nSo which one do you need to track in order to determine if your development processes have improved? The answer is both, since productivity focuses on quantity and efficiency focuses on quality. You want a high quantity of output that works as intended or better.\\n\\n### Developer effectiveness\\n\\nAt Spotify, we also hinge a lot of our success on a third metric: [**developer effectiveness**](https://www.thoughtworks.com/en-us/insights/podcasts/technology-podcasts/developer-effectiveness). If building and shipping code is a human-intensive process, effectiveness measures productivity and efficiency but also takes a qualitative look at the human beings in your org. Do people feel empowered to do their best work? Is their energy being applied in healthy ways to both their own goals and the company\u2019s goals? Is it easy to innovate, experiment, and try new things? Effectiveness evaluates important contexts that allow your organization to address low morale, stress/burnout, and other factors that can contribute to poorer quality and high turnover in the long term.\\n\\n## How we approach metrics\\n\\nSo how do we measure productivity, efficiency, and effectiveness, along with other indicators that can tell you about the quality of the overall developer experience?\\n\\n### Time-to-10th PR\\n\\nBefore we built Backstage in 2016, Spotify was in [a hyper-growth period](https://engineering.atspotify.com/2021/05/18/a-product-story-the-lessons-of-backstage-and-spotifys-autonomous-culture/) and hiring engineers at a breakneck pace. But when we took a look at metrics, we saw our productivity wasn\u2019t getting better, despite all the new hires. Specifically, when we looked at our onboarding metric \u2014 **which we measure as time-to-merge your 10th pull request** \u2014 we saw it had ballooned to 60 days.\\n\\nAs we built Backstage, our north star metric was reducing that onboarding time. And it fell quickly to less than 20 days for a new joiner to merge their 10th PR. Even though you may not be onboarding new engineers as rapidly as we were, this metric is a great proxy for the overall complexity of your ecosystem. And reducing it benefits your whole engineering organization, since longtime team members don\u2019t get tapped on the shoulder as often.\\n\\n### Proxy metrics\\n\\n![86% of internal users are satisfied with Backstage. 80% of contributions are from outside the core team. 150+ plugins contributed from 100+ squads.](spotify-backstage-metrics.png)\\n\\nWe also focus on a few other important proxy metrics for our internal version of Backstage, ranging from feedback from our quarterly developer surveys to more traditional metrics, like daily active users.\\n\\n| **Metric**                     | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\\n| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\\n| What our developers are saying | Every quarter we receive feedback through EngSat \u2014 Spotify\u2019s official engineering satisfaction survey.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\\n| Plugin contributions           | We look at the total number of plugins developed, how many plugin contributions are coming from teams outside the core Backstage team, and the total number of teams that have contributed at least one plugin.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\\n| Ease of discovery              | Or, in other words, an individual contributor\u2019s ability to go from being stuck to unstuck in just a few minutes.

Teams with T-shaped people have fewer bottlenecks and can therefore deliver more consistently. Backstage makes it easier to be T-shaped since tools and infrastructure are consistent between domains, and information is available centrally.                              |\\n| Fragmentation                      | [Software Templates](https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-templates/software-templates-index) help drive standardization in your software ecosystem.

In the quest to do so, we are focusing on simplification and enhancing foundational platform capabilities to empower our developers, suppliers, partners, and travelers.\\n\\nEG Developer Experience proudly adopted Backstage as our developer front door in August 2020 after a successful proof of concept to evaluate search, technical documentation, and plugin contribution capabilities. An amazing partnership blossomed between Spotify, EG, and the broader adopter community as we evolved Backstage for our internal implementation and contributions to Backstage open source.\\n\\nAn important question emerged as Backstage continues to gain momentum with our 6K+ developer community at EG \u2014 how to show the value of Backstage to them in a meaningful way?\\n\\n## Let\u2019s first examine the EG internal developer journey\\n\\nThe EG Developer Experience Team is part of a broader organization called Development Platform & Infrastructure that was chartered to simplify the developer journey.\\n\\nWe kicked off a journey map workshop to refine our developer journey map representing the next 6\u201312 month horizon. We focused on getting these three concepts right:\\n\\n- Align our journey map phases to the DevOps process and software development lifecycle\\n- Identify developer jobs to be done by phase\\n- Identify metrics by phase\\n\\n![Expedia Group Internal Developer Journey Phases, from top to bottom: onboard, build, validate & test, deploy & release, run monitor & run; developer jobs to be done; journey metrics by phase (inputs & outputs); Backstage proof of value metrics](expedia-developer-journey-phases.png)\\n\\n### Developer jobs to be done by phase\\n\\nOur team identified developer jobs to be done (JTBD) by phase to define critical workflows. These jobs to be done follow a user story format. An example JTBD looks like \u201cWhen onboarding as a developer, I want intuitive search so that I can discover EG Platform content quickly.\u201d\\n\\nThis JTBD exercise enables a common steel thread exercise, which means testing developer JTBD on the critical path with an aim to reduce friction. Our goal is to enable as many jobs to be done as possible across the journey within Backstage.\\n\\n### Journey metrics by phase\\n\\nWe then envisioned a set of overall metrics by journey phase. Example metrics include increasing the percentage of people shipping on day one and reducing the lead time for change during the build, validate, and test phases.\\n\\n## And now where things get exciting \u2014 measuring Backstage proof of value\\n\\nProof of value fundamentally means answering the \u201cwhy\u201d for Backstage in a way that resonates with our customers. These metrics are a subset of our overall journey metrics.\\nOur working hypothesis is that increased metrics transparency will be valuable for existing customers and increase willingness for new customers to adopt Backstage and contribute plugins/template actions.\\n\\nWe have oriented our Backstage product roadmap in Q4 (and beyond) to enabling value creation for our customers and simplifying the developer journey by aligning to these metrics.\\n\\nThe proof of value metrics we are starting with:\\n\\n| **Metric**                                                         | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                     | **High Level Work Planned in Q4**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\\n| Ship on day one                                                    | Time from first commit to deploying app code in production                                                                                                                                          | Add curriculum content to developer bootcamp for new hires to leverage Backstage to create a new \u201chello world\u201d app in production on day one\\n\\nPartner with EG IT to automate access to common developer-facing tools when developers receive laptop in hand |\\n\\n| Reduced context switching by increasing number of integrated tools | Measure number of developer-facing tools integrated with Backstage to reduce context switching for developers since they do not need to toggle between multiple tools for developer jobs to be done | Continue plans to integrate with internal developer-facing tools with Backstage in Q4 (e.g., Runtime Compute Platform)                                                                                                                                            |\\n| Search result relevance                                            | Ranking of relevant content developer is searching for out of all search results Monitored by clickthroughs of search results                                                              | Refine proof of concept on search modal to easily view quick results across all content types in Backstage and make contribution back to OS community Enhance user analytics instrumentation for search                                                  |\\n| Technical documentation reach                                      | Number of developers who have viewed a document                                                                                                                                                     | N/A \u2013 initial reporting provided by current user analytics instrumentation                                                                                                                                                                                        |\\n\\nWe are at the initial phase of establishing a baseline for our Backstage proof-of-value metrics.

Join us on December 15.](preview.png)\\n\\n**tl;dr** The Spotify Plugins for Backstage subscription is (almost) here! We\u2019re putting together a bundle of plugins \u2014\xa0made with love at Spotify \u2014 for Backstage adopters to accelerate their developer experience goals. \\n\\n[Register for our December 15 launch event][event] where we\u2019ll be unveiling more details about the bundle. After the event, we\u2019ll share features and documentation for the plugins and how to sign up right here on backstage.spotify.com. \\n\\n_Skip to the \u201cWhat\u2019s in the bundle subscription\u201d section if you\u2019re already in the know on Backstage._\\n\\n\\n### Backstage takes center stage\\n\\nThe house lights go down, the musicians pick up their instruments, and the show begins. What the audience pays attention to from that moment on is what\u2019s right in front of them: the performance. What we forget about (unless a light blows out or an amp malfunctions) is the team of people behind the scenes \u2014 all those technicians and artisans running around in the wings and rafters, wrangling cables, adjusting sliders, and hoisting lighting rigs \u2014 all to ensure the performance we see on stage is a great one. \\n\\nWhen we named our internal developer portal Backstage, it felt like an apt metaphor for technology that helps power the world\u2019s largest audio streaming service. Backstage was built to address a near-universal challenge of complexity. To abstract away the messy parts of a sprawling, fragmented tech ecosystem and give space for developers to focus on what they do best: creating. Backstage is what enables great performances from our developers.\\n\\nIn the nearly three years since Spotify open sourced it, Backstage has become a mature and thriving platform for companies building their own developer portals. We\u2019re now seeing 400+ adopters and 1500+ contributors across the globe using the core framework to create better experiences for hundreds of thousands of their fellow developers. Backstage has been adopted by enterprise companies in healthcare, gaming, manufacturing, government, and more. Companies that look and feel a lot like Spotify _and_ companies that don\u2019t. \\n\\n\\n### Spotify Plugins for Backstage: A bundle of productivity\\n\\nOur goal has always been pretty simple: we want to make Backstage a critical part of everyday workflow to help developers everywhere be happier and more effective. That\u2019s why Backstage is an open source platform and why Spotify is continuing to build with and support the open source community. Last year, when we [first shared our intent to commercialize][announcement] products for Backstage, we talked about how we\'ve only just begun tapping into the potential of Backstage and sharing all that it has done for us at Spotify. \\n\\nToday, I\u2019m happy to share the next step on that journey: Spotify Plugins for Backstage \u2014 a paid subscription that will soon be available to all Backstage adopters. The bundle subscription includes two kinds of plugins: (1) new external versions of some of the most popular plugins we\u2019ve been using inside Spotify for years, and (2) plugins specifically created to unlock more value for companies using Backstage. All of these premium plugins complement the open source plugins we already provide, bringing even more of Spotify\u2019s experience and maturity with Backstage to the platform.\\n\\n\\n#### What\u2019s in the bundle subscription?\\n\\nWe\u2019re launching with a set of plugins that address different aspects of developer experience and engineering culture. We developed this bundle with feedback from a core group of customers \u2014 and now that these versions of the plugins have been road-tested, we\u2019ll offer beta versions to all our Backstage adopters soon ([very soon!][event]). Alongside the plugins themselves, customers can expect support and services to help them get up and running when they buy the bundle.\\n\\nSpotify Plugins for Backstage leverage key features of the Backstage platform: its role as a central hub for all your engineering teams where they do their everyday work, creating data-driven feedback loops between your platform teams and your feature teams to continuously strengthen and improve your internal developer community, and of course, the streamlined UX that reduces complexity and makes it so easy to use.\\n\\n\\n#### Meet the plugins\\n\\nSpotify Plugins for Backstage are aimed at solving common development challenges, reducing operational toil, encouraging best practices, and improving collaboration, transparency, and learning throughout your engineering org \u2014 you know, all those things that pave the way for happier developers and happier code. Here are the plugins that will be available in the bundle.\\n\\n**Soundcheck:** See how well your components measure up to engineering best practices and standards at a glance. When owners can easily see the tech health of their components, it incentivizes quality, reliability, and alignment throughout your software ecosystem. The Soundcheck plugin visualizes checks for security, testing, reliability, and other development and operational standards. And seeing leads to doing. So instead of asking your developers to file and respond to yet another ticket, promote software quality through clear scorecards, actionable feedback, and positive reinforcement.\\n\\n**RBAC:** Manage access and protect your data in Backstage, flexibly and easily. Role-based access control (RBAC) should be as easy to manage as possible \u2014 because the simpler it is to do, the better protected your data will be. Built on top of the open source permissions framework for Backstage, our RBAC plugin provides a no-code management UI for restricting access to plugins, routes, and data within your developer portal. With its intuitive interface, admins can quickly define roles, assign users and groups, and configure permissions to encode authorization decisions according to your organization\u2019s evolving security and compliance needs.\\n\\n**Skill Exchange:** Share expertise across your org by creating an internal marketplace for on-the-job learning opportunities and promoting a culture of self-led growth. Talent, knowledge, and experience can often get trapped inside organizational silos. With the Skill Exchange plugin, now your R&D community can unlock opportunities for collaboration and meaningful connection, no matter where anyone sits in the org chart. Mentors can connect with mentees, teams can connect with temporary help, developers can pair up to program together, and ad hoc teams can assemble to work on hack projects.\\n\\nBy making it easier for your developers to discover and borrow each other\u2019s skills, both teams and individuals can learn, grow, and stretch their abilities together \u2014 leading to happier, more fulfilled, and more capable devs \u2014\xa0no orientation required.\\n\\n**Pulse:** Find out how your R&D teams really feel. Pulse is an R&D survey framework that lets you track key productivity and satisfaction metrics, analyze the anonymized response data to discover trends, and visualize those insights (all within Backstage). Pulse focuses on the concerns of developers and other members of your tech community, telling you everything general HR surveys can\u2019t \u2014 from what your data scientists think about your workflow tooling to the most common blockers teams say they\u2019re facing.\\n\\nBy helping you quantify developer satisfaction and effectiveness, the Pulse plugin allows you to collect the data you need to drive continuous improvements to your R&D tooling, processes, and culture \u2014 and ship code faster.\\n\\n**Insights:** Surveys are great for capturing how your people feel. But you also want to know how they\u2019re actually behaving. The Insights plugin is your window into Backstage usage at your organization. It captures and displays key data points, including your daily active Backstage users and most commonly used plugins. With the Insights plugin, you can measure Backstage adoption, understand user behavior, and identify trends. Knowing how your teams are using Backstage today helps you meet the demands of tomorrow.\\n\\n\\n### Why is Spotify selling plugins?\\n\\nWe love a freemium business model here at Spotify. Our investment with Backstage is following suit with our consumer offerings \u2014 in this case, the subscription is meant to enhance what\u2019s available in open source. The overarching question we asked when developing these plugins was, \u201cWill this make Backstage more useful and powerful for open source adopters?\u201d And that\u2019s the question we\u2019ll continue to ask as we evolve the subscription. \\n\\nWe hope that by adding paid plugins from Spotify to the other commercial services surrounding Backstage, the platform becomes more valuable to current adopters, we\u2019ll broaden its reach to new adopters, and we\u2019ll create a more diverse ecosystem for the community at large.\\n\\n\\n#### Sustaining the platform and the community\\n\\nThe bundle subscription is also how we see Spotify continuing to sustain its investment in Backstage. Revenue generated from the bundle can be reinvested into developing and releasing more plugins \u2014\xa0including more of the 200+ plugins we use internally \u2014 and evolving Backstage further. We see this is a good thing for our community, for our teams, and our customers.\\n\\nBut to be clear: Spotify is not moving away from open source contributions or the Backstage project community. Instead, we\u2019re doubling down on Backstage, and the bundle subscription enables Spotify to continue to grow our investment in the open source project and community.\\n\\nA core part of our company mission is to unlock human potential and creativity. Developers are creators \u2014 some of the most prolific creators given that every company is now a technology company.

Spoiler alert: It makes all three better!\\n\\n\\n## How Backstage translates to quantifiable impact\\n\\nAt Spotify, we get a lot of questions around Backstage and the value it can give to organizations, and rightly so. We talk about how Backstage makes developers happier and more productive, but what does that actually mean in practice? A couple years ago, we [published a blog](https://backstage.spotify.com/blog/measuring-backstage-success-at-spotify/) detailing how we measure Backstage success at Spotify. This blog highlighted proxy metrics to gauge things we care about moving the needle on like time-to-tenth-PR, number of plugins contributed, satisfaction rates, etc.\\n\\nBut this time around, we wanted to share metrics that we believe affect a business\u2019 bottom line through a clear return on investment: developer activity, development lifecycle, and developer retention. And we found some pretty cool stuff\u2026\\n\\nAt Spotify, we see frequent Backstage users:\\n\\n![roidata](roidata.png)\\n\\nThat\u2019s a lot! So let\u2019s unpack all of these stats a bit.\\n\\n\\n## Spotify devs do better with Backstage\\n\\nBefore we get too deep into the findings, let\u2019s talk about  our methodology for this analysis. Michael Bellato, Senior Data Scientist at Spotify, observed Backstage activity for the first half of 2022 for developers. After observing that group, he measured developer activities, retention, and satisfaction for the same group for the next 6 months to a year. For simplicity, this pre-post approach in our analysis does not account for potential seasonality effects. As well, given the level of adoption for Backstage within Spotify with our internal developer community, there was no possibility to carry out our analysis by using a control group of non Backstage users. We therefore used observational methods to determine Backstage\u2019s value and grouped users into 2 categories: frequent and less frequent users. In order to ensure both groups of users were as comparable as possible, we then controlled and matched factors such as their tenure (in number of weeks) and work mode (i.e. office or remote).\\n\\nNow onto the findings! At Spotify, we believe that Backstage improves developer effectiveness, which is a function of satisfaction and productivity. So we set out to quantify what these terms mean in practice for us. For satisfaction, we felt that retention was a good indicator of how a developer\u2019s happiness or satisfaction at a company affects the bottom line. For productivity, we looked at developer output and speed. Lastly, we found what Backstage means for the longevity of a developer\u2019s output. \\n\\n\\n### Productivity\\n\\nThere are so many ways to quantify productivity. Through user research we have discovered that Backstage increases productivity through the ability to find, understand, and take action on information; in general, organizations find they are able to do more with less. With consideration to these findings, we have focused this research on productivity as developer output and speed.\\n\\nFirst, we found that developers that use Backstage more often have 2.3x more developer activity in GitHub in the following six months than the bottom Backstage users. From our internal developer survey that we send out every quarter we also noticed that developers that are more active have higher ratings of their perceived productivity (Psst! If you\u2019re interested in setting up your own survey in Backstage, check out [Pulse](https://backstage.spotify.com/plugins/pulse/)).\\n\\n![graph showing more github activity for frequent backstage users](graph1.png)\\n\\nWe also saw that frequent Backstage users create over 2x more code changes than infrequent Backstage users. On top of that, these code changes take 17% less cycle time for more frequent Backstage users.\\n\\n![graph showing more code changes for people that use backstage frequently](graph2.png)\\n\\nWhen we combined the reduced cycle time with increased PR activity, we found that this had an effect of saving 3 full time employees (FTEs) for a team of 10 developers.  Developers that are more productive in less time, save time and resources for an engineering organization.\\n\\n\\n### Development lifecycle and speed\\n\\nBut what does speed matter if you\u2019re not able to ensure improvements in the overall development lifecycle? When your developers deploy new software, you want to ensure it meets standards and you don\u2019t have to change or deprecate it in short order. From user research we found that Backstage\u2019s flexibility enables organizations to address a wide range of needs in a wide range of contexts, thus adding efficiencies to existing capabilities. These efficiencies are what we have been able to confirm at Spotify with the adoption of Backstage throughout the different stages of the development lifecycle; evidenced with the productivity improvements measured in our most recent analysis. At Spotify, we found that high frequency Backstage users deploy software to production 2x as often and their software stays deployed 3x as long. We believe that higher rates of deployments to production and their increased longevity are indications of higher code quality, as well as increased developer speed and productivity.\\n![graph showing more code changes for longer](graph3.png)\\n\\n\\n### Satisfaction\\n\\nIn our analysis, we found that employees that use Backstage more frequently are 5% more likely to be at Spotify 12 months later. For a team of 100 developers, this is an increase in five FTEs. Keeping your developers happy matters.\\n\\n![graph showing spotify retention affected by backstage](graph4.png)\\n\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nAt Spotify, high frequency Backstage users deploy software more often in less time. These users are more active, report higher perceived productivity ratings, and stay at Spotify longer.\\n\\nWe plan to continue this type of research and share our results with you because we believe in the power of Backstage and how it affects a company\u2019s bottom line.\\n\\nBut don\u2019t just take our word for it! Adopters like Toyota North American Motors have [run their own analysis](https://backstage.spotify.com/blog/adopter-spotlight-toyota/) and found huge savings (to the tune of $10M) with Backstage.\\n\\nInterested in sharing your Backstage story?

Is it by measuring something arbitrary, like how many lines of code they\u2019ve written or how many commits they\u2019ve made? Nope. How much useful data are you really getting out of those numbers anyway?\\n\\nInstead, it\u2019s more helpful to think of performance in terms of \u201cdeveloper effectiveness\u201d. Suddenly, it\u2019s not about the quantity of work and time spent, but the quality. Are engineers wasting a bunch of their days just trying to find what they need to get started, or are they able to jump straight into the work they really want to do with as few blockers as possible?\\n\\nPia Nilsson, Director of Engineering and Head of Platform Developer Experience at Spotify, addressed these and other questions on the [Thoughtworks podcast](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/podcasts/technology-podcasts/developer-effectiveness): What types of problems do Spotify engineers face? And why did we create [Backstage](https://backstage.spotify.com/) to address those issues? Read on to find out how exactly Backstage helped us, and how you can use Backstage to boost the effectiveness of your own team.\\n\\n## Growing pains\\n\\nAs Pia explains in the podcast, when she started at Spotify in 2016, we were facing an interesting problem. We were in the middle of a hiring boom during a period of exponential growth. From the outside, everything seemed to be moving along swimmingly. But internally, a few metrics were giving us pause; specifically, our productivity wasn\u2019t increasing at all, even with all the new hires.\\n\\nSo we did what we always do: we looked at the data. We had a few metrics for determining and monitoring developer effectiveness \u2014 deployment frequency, for instance \u2014 but the most crucial was our onboarding metric. You see, we gauge how well our onboarding process is working by measuring how long it takes for a new engineer to make their tenth pull request. And in the midst of our hiring frenzy, that number was getting incredibly high: over 60 days. Clearly something had to be done, but what were the issues developers were facing to begin with?\\n\\nPia and her team looked into the issue, and this was the feedback she got back from the engineers, in her own words:\\n\\n1. \u201cFirst, it was the context switching \u2026 because we had a very fragmented ecosystem. Why did we have a fragmented ecosystem? \u2026 Every single team is like a little startup, and it\u2019s free to charge ahead and reach their mission by themselves \u2026 This is very conducive for speed, but when we grow, that\u2019s where stuff starts to break down. Of course, this leads to a lot of cognitive load for our engineers.\u201d\\n\\n1. \u201cThe number two blocker was that it\u2019s just hard to find things. Which service should I be integrating with as an engineer? Should I use the user data service that the customer service team has built? Or should I use the slightly different user data service that the premium team has built? Or should I just go ahead and build my own? This, of course, leads to further fragmentation, and we\u2019re back to problem number one.\u201d\\n\\nConsidering both of these challenges, it\u2019s clear that as Spotify grew, our famously autonomous culture was also driving our working environment to become increasingly convoluted and disparate. No one was on the same page, and it was starting to weigh us down. The obvious solution, of course, would be to mandate our engineers use the same technologies and microservices so that we started acting more as a monolith.\\n\\nBut that just wouldn\u2019t fly at Spotify. Again, our autonomous culture, and all the freedom that comes with it, was a big reason a lot of people liked working at Spotify to begin with. It\u2019s key to our identity. Mandating our problems away was out of the question.\\n\\nWhat else could we do? What we needed was a solution that prioritized developers and their ways of working. What we needed was a place where everyone could go to find everything they needed, no matter what it was. What we needed was Backstage.\\n\\n## Backstage: a platform for your platforms\\n\\nAs Pia notes, Spotify developed [Backstage](https://engineering.atspotify.com/2020/03/17/what-the-heck-is-backstage-anyway/) to help our engineers do three different things: find stuff, manage stuff, and create stuff. In other words, it\u2019s built to address all the blockers our engineers were facing, especially in terms of discoverability.\\n\\nWhere our engineers used to spend hours of their week just looking for things \u2014 documentation, platforms, systems and their owners \u2014 all over the internet, now they can find everything in one place: Backstage. Similarly, rather than moving from tab to tab, checking to see the health of, say, their Kubernetes clusters or the status of their recent deployment, engineers can now use Backstage to bring together monitoring tools, logging, their CI/CD pipeline, and whatever else our engineers needed to manage.\\n\\nNow, let\u2019s say our engineers want to spin up a new ML model, data pipeline, or some other component or microservice. Rather than building something on their own, introducing yet another instance of boilerplate code similar to a dozen others in our ecosystem, they can now use Backstage to do that work for them. Not only does this save them time if they choose to do this, but these new components and services are also set up using our own best practices and tech standards \u2014 what we call our [Golden Paths](https://engineering.atspotify.com/2020/08/17/how-we-use-golden-paths-to-solve-fragmentation-in-our-software-ecosystem/).\\n\\nBecause of this, we\u2019re able to have our cake and eat it too. Our engineers and squads can remain entirely autonomous, even as Backstage nudges them toward walking down these Golden Paths, thereby increasing our teams\u2019 alignment and keeping our ecosystem from becoming more fragmented. Additionally, because [Backstage is a rapidly growing open source tool](https://github.com/backstage/backstage), more and more features and plugins are constantly being added for a variety of use cases beyond the ones mentioned here.\\n\\nSo, with all that being said, was Backstage worth all the time and money we invested into it? Well, let\u2019s go back to the onboarding metrics one more time. Remember when Pia discovered that it took over 60 days for onboarding engineers to merge their tenth pull request? After Backstage was introduced, that number dropped to only 20. \u201cAnd if you have numbers like that in your organization,\u201d mentions Pia, \u201cI find that it\u2019s easy to get buy-in for investments in developer experience.\u201d\\n\\nInterested in hearing more about Backstage and what it can do for you?

At this point, we\u2019ve spoken with hundreds of companies at various stages in their Backstage journey. Those conversations run the gamut but most often the question we hear is, [\u201cHow do I get started with Backstage?\u201d](https://backstage.io/blog/2021/05/20/adopting-backstage)\\n\\nIf you\u2019ve been asking yourself the same thing, the good news is: you\u2019re not the first and you\u2019re not alone. Backstage is still new, but we\u2019ve now crossed over 18 months with the project in the wild. And we\u2019ve learned a ton: how unique each organization\u2019s needs are, when flexibility and customization can lead to paralysis, and where teams have found quick wins in building better developer experience.\\n\\nSo if you\u2019re curious about how to get started with Backstage, [give us a shout](https://info.backstage.spotify.com/office-hours) and book a one-to-one meeting. Given our 5+ years of experience as the original adopter, the Spotify team brings a lot of lessons learned and perspective on how to position the investment needed to bring a developer portal to life.\\n\\nWe\u2019re also happy to connect you with [other adopters](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/ADOPTERS.md) in the community.

We \u2764\ufe0f our Backstage community and can\u2019t wait to see how our Community Sessions evolve over the next year! In the spirit of loving our community, learning how our adopters are using Backstage, and hearing about what projects our contributors are working on, let\u2019s dig a little deeper into each of the sessions from this month\u2026\\n\\n## Watch the adopters session\\n\\n<youtube url=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/evf_LV0KzIk\\" title=\\"Backstage Community Session 13 \u2014 Adopters: February 23, 2022\\">\\n</youtube>\\n\\nHighlights from this Adopters Session include:\\n\\n- **Maintainer Update on stabilizing core APIs**: Spotify\u2019s Patrik Oldsberg lets us know to keep an eye out for changes in upcoming releases of Backstage. One important change includes stabilizing core APIs in the scaffolder and catalog plugins. Most of these changes will be in the underlying typescript APIs.\\n\\n- **More on Homepage Templates!**: We launched Homepage templates on January 25, which allows you to customize your Backstage homepage! In this Community Session, we follow up to [this blog post on Homepage templates](https://backstage.io/blog/2022/01/25/backstage-homepage-templates) with a demo and roadmap ideas for the new feature. Spotify\u2019s Himanshu Mishra takes us through a demo on how to get started with Homepage Templates followed by Emma Indal reviewing components and reveals that we are designing two more Homepage Templates. Check out [this Getting Started tutorial](https://backstage.io/docs/getting-started/homepage) for step-by-step instructions on updating your homepage.\\n\\n- **Discover useful info with Catalog entity insights**: Spotify\u2019s Fredrik Adel\xf6w shows us how to unearth useful information about any catalog entity. By clicking the three dots menu in the upper right hand corner of your entity views in Backstage, you can find information like raw yaml, uid, ancestry data, and other metadata for your entities. This new tool provides deeper, technical information for those that want it.\\n\\n- **Q&A**: Any ideas on how to move existing knowledge bases to TechDocs? What do different organizations\' engineering teams look like for supporting Backstage?\\n\\n## Watch the contributors session\\n\\n<youtube url=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Buu_KWdIFwU\\" title=\\"Backstage Community Session 13 \u2014 Adopters: February 16, 2022\\">\\n</youtube>\\n\\nHighlights from this Contributors Session include:\\n\\n- **Vote for Contributor Spotlight**: Like we said before, we love our community and we want to highlight and appreciate all the invaluable work our contributors add to Backstage. So, if you know of a contributor hustling on Backstage, please [nominate them here](https://forms.gle/8Z8UYdcU6LCcCxTg6). Alternatively, if you want Backstage swag (and who doesn\u2019t??) and contribute to Backstage, nominate yourself!\\n\\n- **New proposal for a TechDocs add-on framework**: Spotify\u2019s Eric Peterson, introduces us to a new proposal for a TechDocs add-on framework that encourages high quality docs, more collaboration, and improved usability. The new, proposed framework augments the default TechDocs experience with render times, accessibility features, and more. We want to make sure that your voice is heard as we continue to work on this feature, so please [check out the RFC](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/issues/9636) and let us know what type of add-ons would be helpful for you!\\n\\n- **URL Reader demo**: Himanshu is back at it again with a demo in this session. He walks us through his favorite core utility of Backstage \u2013 [the URL Reader](https://backstage.io/docs/plugins/url-reader#concept) \u2013 describes its benefits, use cases, and then ends with a demo. The URL Reader capability is great for our contributors as it helps easily pull information from external locations without worrying about platform specific API calls, cache, authentication, etc...\\n\\n- **Q&A**: What are best practices for maintaining and creating users and groups? What are typical patterns for creating plugins? Are there more public repos of Backstage?\\n\\n## That\u2019s a wrap\\n\\nFrom deep dives to demos to hearing from our community and watching Himanshu thrive not only as a host but as a demo king, we covered a lot in our community sessions this month.

Their open source tool Krateo acts as a single control pane for any resource, whether it\u2019s a K8s cluster, microservice, application, pipeline, database, or anything else. Diego Braga shows how Krateo uses Backstage, Kubernetes, and Crossplane to make it easy for anyone to harness the power of the CNCF landscape. If a YAML file can reference it, then Krateo can manage it. [Give Krateo a try yourself][krateo].\\n- **Adding more clouds to Cost Insights:** Spotify\u2019s Tim Hansen takes us on a tour of the Cost Insights plugin \u2014 the Backstage plugin that helped Spotify save millions of dollars in cloud costs in a matter of months. (Wait, what? [Yep][cost].) The plugin is compatible with GCP out of the box, but the team is looking for contributors to add support for more cloud providers. Are you an AWS or Azure expert? PRs welcome!\\n- **Migrating with Tech Insights:** Roadie\u2019s Jussi Hallila answers a question from the community on how the Tech Insights plugin might help drive internal software migrations, along with a quick update on the plugin as it nears its first release.\\n- **Q&A with the maintainers:** What\u2019s the best way to get software templates for databases, Terraform, and Backstage to play nicely together?\\n\\n## Watch the contributors session\\n\\n<youtube url=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/AHdDrcGwxhs\\" title=\\"Backstage Community Session 12 \u2014 Contributors: January 26, 2022\\">\\n</youtube>\\n\\nHighlights from the contributors session include:\\n\\n- **What\u2019s in a version number?:** As the 1.0 release for Backstage approaches, the maintainers are planning to move away from date-based version numbers. But what does 1.0 really mean? Or 1.0.1? The maintainers have thought long and hard about the release process for the future versions of Backstage (both the app and the individual plugin packages), so that you know what to expect going from x.1.x to x.2.x \u2014 and everything in-between. Learn more about the proposed [Release Process & Versioning Policy][versions] and share your feedback.\\n- **Permissions framework live demo:** Joe Porpeglia from Spotify shows off how to activate and manage permissions policies in Backstage using the soon-to-be-released permissions framework.\\n\\n  ![Joe blazes through a live demo of the Backstage permissions framework](permissions-framework-demo.gif \'\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25 See if you can keep up with Joe\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25 \u2014 the new permissions framework he demoed is now available for testing.\')\\n\\n  First, marvel at the weird way Joe puts his file list on the right side of his IDE, then watch him \ud83d\udd12 restrict a user\u2019s ability to unregister entities in the software catalog, all in front of a live audience. The chat was overflowing with \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f \u2014 both for the simplicity of the framework and for Joe\u2019s live demoing agility.\\n\\n  An important feature for many adopters, the permissions framework is available for testing in the app right now, ahead of the official release. Have feedback? Let us know in the **#permissions** channel in the Backstage community [Discord][invite].\\n\\n- **Employing task workers for the Backstage scaffolder:** Roadie introduces their more secure, scalable infrastructure for running scaffolder tasks, separate from backend privileges. Task workers are handy, and in some cases essential, when you\u2019re a Backstage service provider, like Roadie, working with customers who need to restrict how the network, load balancers, and other internal resources are shared. Using Roadie\u2019s task workers implementation, scaffolder tasks are run, scheduled, and stored in a constrained environment, making deployment tasks safer and easier.\\n- **Q&A with the maintainers:** When is Backstage 1.0 coming and more on the Q1 2022 product roadmap.\\n\\n[Subscribe to the Community Session calendar][gh] \u2192\\n\\n[q1]: https://backstage.io/docs/overview/roadmap\\n[krateo]: https://github.com/krateoplatformops/krateo\\n[cost]: https://backstage.io/blog/2020/10/22/cost-insights-plugin\\n[versions]: https://github.com/backstage/backstage/pull/8971\\n[invite]: https://discord.gg/backstage-687207715902193673\\n[gh]: https://github.com/backstage/community"},{"id":"/community-session/11-brex-backstage-upgrade-helper","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/community-session/11-brex-backstage-upgrade-helper","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/community-session/11-brex-backstage-upgrade-helper/index.md","source":"@site/blog/community-session/11-brex-backstage-upgrade-helper/index.md","title":"Community Session: Brex, Backstage Upgrade Helper, branding tips, and more","description":"Watch the videos for Brex\u2019s adopter journey, a demo of the new app upgrade tool, branding tips, and other holiday treats.","date":"2023-07-13T12:03:53.095Z","formattedDate":"July 13, 2023","tags":[],"readingTime":6.01,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Suzanne Daniels, Spotify"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Community Session: Brex, Backstage Upgrade Helper, branding tips, and more","description":"Watch the videos for Brex\u2019s adopter journey, a demo of the new app upgrade tool, branding tips, and other holiday treats.","author":"Suzanne Daniels, Spotify","publishedISODate":"2021-12-16","previewImage":"./preview.png"},"prevItem":{"title":"Community Session: The road to 1.0, permissions framework preview, and more","permalink":"/blog/community-session/12-q1-2022-roadmap-permissions-demo"},"nextItem":{"title":"Community Session: Box debuts their Backstage developer portal, plugin news, and more","permalink":"/blog/community-session/10-box-and-spotify-paid-plugins"}},"content":"![Brex shares their Backstage adoption journey, Backstage Upgrade Helper demo, and holiday treats](community-session-11.png)\\n\\nWatch the Community Session videos below for a grab bag of holiday treats, including eye-catching year-end stats and infographics, lessons on adopting from finance startup [Brex][brex], tips on branding your Backstage portal, and a demo of the [Backstage Upgrade Helper][helper] \u2014 your new best friend when upgrading to the latest version of the Backstage app. First up: a look at Brex\u2019s adoption journey.\\n\\n## Keeping up with hyper-growth at Brex with Backstage\\n\\nBrex is that rare breed of startup known as a decacorn (TIL: that\u2019s a \ud83e\udd84 \xd7 10). Unsurprisingly, the highly valued fintech company has been growing fast. They first started thinking about a developer portal when their team was fewer than 100 people. But their headcount kept doubling, and before they knew it, the team had grown to 500 engineers, project managers, and designers, all in a span of a few months. Tooling was growing along with the number of people, and it was becoming difficult for anyone to figure out how things were done.

(When James, who is also an active member of the Backstage support channel on [Discord][discord], first unveiled the service page in his presentation, it elicited one \u201cSo pretty\u201d, a \u201cWoah\u201d, and a \u201cHoo boy\u201d from the chatroom.)\\n\\nIn the presentation, you\u2019ll hear about how Brex quickly got a Backstage MVP up and running, how their production version helps them onboard the nonstop stream of new developers, which built-in features and community plugins they use, which ones they\u2019ve custom made (including a workflow plugin, as we previously saw with [Box][box]), how Brex promotes and evangelizes adoption internally, what metrics they use to measure usage and success, and what they\u2019ve been learning all along the way.\\n\\n### To fork or not to fork\\n\\n![Learnings: Scaffolder was a massive improvement, but didn\'t drive weekly or daily usage; Two sided marketplace: users and platform developers; Metrics are important, Usage driven by actions more than information; Monorepo support has improved over past year, Forking Backstage made our lives more difficult; Great community!](brex-learnings.png \'A slide from Brex\u2019s presentation \u2014 the last two points are not completely unrelated.\')\\n\\nOne hard-learned lesson from Brex\u2019s journey so far: \u201cForking Backstage made our lives more difficult.\u201d\\n\\nEarlier this year, the team at Brex switched to an internal fork of Backstage. They quickly began to realize the drawbacks of losing access to everything the community has to offer and not being able to keep their app up to date easily and quickly.\\n\\nAfter taking this little detour on their adoption path, Brex spent a few months reversing course, making their way back to the open source version of the app and returning to the land of easy updates and constant product improvements. (Welcome back, Brex!)\\n\\nWatch the whole adopters session to learn more about their journey, including other valuable lessons and the road ahead.\\n\\n## Watch the adopters session\\n\\n<youtube url=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0QMQYSTKAx0\\" title=\\"Backstage Community Session 11 \u2014 Adopters: December 15, 2021\\">\\n</youtube>\\n\\nAlong with Brex\u2019s adoption journey, other highlights from the session include:\\n\\n- **Visualizing our growing community:** See every single contribution to the Backstage source code in 2021 and where in the world all those contributions are coming from. (For more year-end stats and milestones, read our \u201c[Backstage Wrapped 2021][wrapped]\u201d post.)\\n\\n- **Steal our stuff:** A lot of you have been asking us for ways to help explain Backstage to your internal teams. So, based on our experience over the last 18+ months talking with tech orgs of all shapes and sizes, we created two resources that you can share with your fellow devs, engineering managers, or even the CTO:\\n\\n  1. **[\u201cWhat is Backstage?\u201d Explainer Video][video]:** All the frustrations of infrastructure complexity \u2014 and all the joys of a Backstage developer portal \u2014 explained in 129 seconds.\\n\\n  2. **[Google Slide decks][decks]:** One deck is short and sweet, the other is bigger and nerdier. Feel free to steal both presentations to use as your own and spread the word about how Backstage can improve developer experience and developer effectiveness wherever you work.\\n\\n- **Tips on branding your Backstage developer portal:** Should you keep the name \u201cBackstage\u201d or brand your developer portal like other adopters have done (American Airlines\u2019 \u201cRunway\u201d, Netflix\u2019s \u201cSpotlight\u201d, Zalando\u2019s \u201cSunrise\u201d)? Hear why we think branded is better for building your internal Backstage community and welcoming your engineers to their shiny new developer portal.\\n\\n## Watch the contributors session\\n\\n<youtube url=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/nYjI2j-lWEM\\" title=\\"Backstage Community Session 11 \u2014 Contributors: December 16, 2021\\">\\n</youtube>\\n\\nHighlights from the contributors session include:\\n\\n- **Introducing the Backstage Upgrade Helper:** In this demo, we hear from Spotify engineer Vincenzo (and his young baby), as he shows off a new tool that makes upgrading your Backstage app easier and safer.\\n\\n  ![Backstage Upgrade Helper demo](backstage-upgrade-helper.gif \'Backstage Upgrade Helper in action: just click the blue button to see version diffs in a jiff.\')\\n\\n  Modeled on the React Native Upgrade Helper, the [Backstage Upgrade Helper][helper] displays the important differences between your current version and the version you are upgrading to. So now you can prepare for significant changes without being surprised.\\n\\n- **Last days of deprecations:** Speaking of upgrades, more deprecations are coming your way in the next app update. But the team expects this to be the last round of breaking changes to the core library for the frontend for the foreseeable future. (Yee-ha!)\\n\\n- **Contributor Spotlight:** Our contributor of the month is Phil Kuang ([@kuangp][kuangp]) from FactSet Research Systems, a data technology company that serves over 6,000 financial service firms. Phil is a software engineer at FactSet \u2014 and also the sole maintainer of their Backstage instance. After discovering Backstage about a year ago and building an MVP on his own, he made his first pull request back to the project in March and has continued to contribute a [steady stream of PRs][prs] ever since. His dedication and enthusiasm for Backstage is greatly appreciated by the maintainers and the whole community. Thank you, Phil!\\n\\n- **Q&A with the maintainers:** A discussion about different approaches to integrating usage metrics into Backstage \u2014 what kinds of actions should be tracked for analytics? Plus, a few bonus questions for the maintainers: How do you manage the constant stream of PRs? (Related: [reviewers wanted][issue]!) What\u2019s good PR etiquette? What\u2019s the best way to break up PRs? And what\u2019s it like working with the Backstage community?\\n\\nAre you part of the Backstage community?

Plus, what\u2019s coming next with the Backstage Kubernetes plugin, adoption and contribution tips, Q&A, and more. But first: Box says hello to the community.\\n\\n## Unboxing the Box DevPortal\\n\\nBox DevOps engineer [Jarek \u0141ukow][jluk-box] gave us an inside look at the company\u2019s Backstage implementation. After the Box team incorporated their existing service catalog and grabbed a few open source plugins from the [Plugin Marketplace][plugins], their Backstage MVP was off to a solid start.\\n\\nNext, the team used Backstage Software Templates (aka the Scaffolder) to make it easier for their engineers to create new services: just click through a few form fields, and a \u201cHello World\u201d skeleton project is automatically set up in a new repo with the first build already running. But the team wanted to go further, pushing automation and standardization beyond the CI pipeline.\\n\\n### \u201cA higher-order pipeline\u201d\\n\\nWhenever a developer uses the Box DevPortal to create a service, they don\u2019t just get a component built to Box\u2019s engineering best practices. Each new component also enters an onboarding workflow that makes it easy to adopt other organizational standards, from policy compliance to budget reviews.\\n\\nThese higher-order pipelines automate practices that were previously considered \u201cnon-technical\u201d, making the processes more accessible and more engineering-friendly. The workflows are also designed to be customizable, so that any team can add their own.\\n\\n### \u201cIt has the UX to do it right\u201d\\n\\n![Hello from Box: the Box DevPortal service catalog, component overview page, custom Jira widgets, and onboarding workflow](box-backstage-demo.gif \'Say hello to the Box DevPortal.\')\\n\\nAlong with being a single place for engineers to go, Box says Backstage \u201chas the UX to do it right\u201d. Other highlights from Box\u2019s presentation:\\n\\n- **Ready-to-use plugins:** As Box started adopting [plugins built by the Backstage community][plugins], they happily discovered that because of their high quality, they could start using most of these open source plugins right away, making it unnecessary to create custom versions for themselves. (Yay, community!)\\n- **Beyond the CI pipeline:** In addition to using [Backstage Software Templates][beta] for creating standardized components, the Box team also built standardization workflows for policy compliance, security approvals, API governance, access control, and everything else their developers need to onboard and manage a service \u2014 all integrated right inside Backstage.\\n- **A central hub:** By integrating different systems and departments scattered across their engineering org, the Box DevPortal streamlines processes that used to be handled by a mishmash of Slack messages, random video calls, piles of support tickets, and [other engineering time sucks][xkcd].\\n- **Prefect.io plugin demo:** Stay tuned till the end to see Box\u2019s custom [Prefect][io] plugin in action, converting complex workflows into a simple UI \u2014 exactly the kind of developer-friendly experience Backstage was made for.\\n\\n### \u201cThis is awesome\u2026now automate everything else\u201d\\n\\n![Box Backstage Journey slide. Why Backstage is perfect: It\u2019s the single place to put the automation that doesn\u2019t belong anywhere else. It has the UX to do it right. It has the potential to initiate a long-term change in the organization.](box-backstage-perfect-slide.png \'Our second favorite slide from the Box presentation. (Our favorite is still their service catalog page \u2014 we are suckers for well-organized software components.)\')\\n\\nInternal feedback at Box was positive. When their developer portal launched and the team shared these automation features with the wider engineering community at Box, Jarek says the response could be summed up as, \u201cThis is awesome. Now what I would like you to do is automate everything else.\u201d It sounds like Box\u2019s journey with Backstage has just begun.\\n\\nJarek covers a lot more in his presentation (custom widgets!), so make sure to watch the whole thing in the adopters session video below.\\n\\n## Watch the adopters session\\n\\n<youtube url=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/apCDT3_DmFk\\" title=\\"Backstage Community Session 10 \u2014 Adopters: November 17, 2021\\">\\n</youtube>\\n\\nBefore Box took center stage, the Spotify team informed the community about plans for introducing paid plugins in 2022. Plus, Q&A with big questions, like \u201cHow will I know if Backstage will work at a large company like mine?\u201d\\n\\n- **Spotify shares news from the future:** In 2022, Spotify is going to start selling plugins for Backstage. This is in addition to the open source plugins that the team will continue to develop and contribute to the community. Over the years, Spotify has built tons of internal plugins and we continue to create brand-new ones. By introducing some of these plugins as commercial products, Spotify is doubling down on Backstage with a sustainable business model as the cornerstone to our long-term commitment to the project.

Why should you build up your internal Backstage community with hackathons and meetups? And what kind of adoption has Backstage seen at large organizations, such as government agencies, financial institutions, and telcos (e.g. [TELUS][session04], Canada\u2019s largest telecommunications company)? You\u2019ll have to watch the video to find out.\\n\\n## Watch the contributors session\\n\\n<youtube url=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/n1OWGwYAOiI\\" title=\\"Backstage Community Session 10 \u2014 Contributors: November 18, 2021\\">\\n</youtube>\\n\\nIn the contributors track for this month\u2019s community session, hear about upcoming deprecations, the fruits of Hacktoberfest, the future of both the Kubernetes plugin and the Tech Insights plugin, tips on contributing, and more. Highlights include:\\n\\n- **Maintainer update on ongoing deprecations:** Out with the old, in with the new. Look for more deprecations coming your way as maintainers continue to stabilize core parts of the project, particularly in the frontend plugins (core-app-api, core-plugin-api, errors, config, etc.). So make sure to read those changelogs for smoother migrations!\\n- **Contributor Spotlight**: Hooray for Hacktoberfest! Our contributor of the month is Colton ([@cmpadden][profile]), data engineer and web developer at Georgetown University. He got started with Backstage during [Hacktoberfest][linkedin], refactoring the Create App CLI ([#7844][7844]) and improving support for TechDocs on GCS and S3 ([#7554][7554]). But once he discovered how welcoming the community was, he just kept on contributing ([#8096][commit]: Mmm\u2026donuts). Thanks, Colton, and welcome to the Backstage community!\\n- **Future contributions to the Kubernetes plugin:** Spotify\u2019s Warp Speed squad share their ideas on what to consider when contributing to the Backstage Kubernetes plugin going forward \u2014 including updates on the team\u2019s recent work refactoring and simplifying duplicate code, upcoming changes to Kubernetes\u2019 main API that will soon make it easier to show resource usage in Backstage (for example, CPU/memory usage per container), adding direct links to logs regardless of cloud provider, ideas for further customization returning objects, and more. [Feedback, suggestions, and, of course, contributions are welcome!][k8s-rfc]\\n- **More advice on contributing to Backstage:** Hear more thoughts on the best ways to work with the Backstage maintainers and core teams. Thinking about a big change? Raise an issue early on. Have a rough idea for something? Try writing a draft pull request sharing a little bit of code and then get feedback on whether to continue further.\\n- **Updates on the Tech Insights plugin:** Jussi Hallila from Roadie.io shares the latest on stage 2 of the Tech Insights plugin \u2014 including progress on [scorecards][ui-rfc], fact retrievers, and building an MVP for displaying a \u201c[time-to-10th pull request][measuring]\u201d metric. As Jussi says, the more contributions, the better!\\n\\nWant even more demos, updates, and discussion?

As a software development team at TELUS, we support that mission by building hundreds of apps and services for our customers, partners and fellow team members which can mean a lot of change. Change is good and can be exciting, but personally, I think boring is better. \\n\\nAs an early adopter, we\u2019ve learned a lot and wanted to share our story alongside some important lessons we think other adopters can benefit from as they begin their Backstage journey. \\n\\n\\n## Breaking down monoliths\\n\\nNot only has our team of over 2,500 developers grown quickly over the past few years, we\u2019ve also been actively breaking down multiple software monoliths. As our team grew bigger, centralized locations for tools, information, and best practices quickly fell apart and became siloed. A few years ago, we found that our developer platform \u2014 originally built as a shadow IT project \u2014 had hit its ceiling. The world had shifted in terms of developer experience best practices and we needed something new. \\n\\nOur goal was to create a common touchpoint where we could evangelize better defaults so people chose our platform over one-off, siloed solutions. We wanted to enable faster builds at lower cost and create sustainable software groups through a single pane of glass that surfaced our \u201cclass A\u201d tools: something deeply standardized (aka boring) to help everyone do their best work more efficiently lower in the stack, and freeing them up to be more interesting and innovative where it counts.\\n\\nWith all this in mind, we started to build our own developer portal because we couldn\u2019t find anything that would do the job. Until we came across Backstage. \\n\\n\\n## From Backstage to Simplify \\n\\nWith our partner, [Thoughtworks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/), we started exploring Backstage early in 2021. After thorough evaluation, we decided to move forward with Backstage even though the project was in the early stages. It was clear what Spotify had built felt like a true values alignment with TELUS and our vision of democratizing development. \\n\\nWe also really liked that Backstage was an open source project where we could pull in innovation from a growing community and contribute back in kind. It was way more appealing than paying for an off-the-shelf SaaS tool that we\u2019d have to end up heavily customizing anyway. Adopting Backstage has been a big turning point for our open source efforts more broadly at TELUS and we\u2019re now building an open source software contribution and consumption policy. \\n\\nWe opted to call our developer portal \u201cSimplify\u201d because that\u2019s exactly what it needed to do for our developers. \\n\\n\\n## Lessons from a (very) early adopter \\n\\nWe\u2019ve learned a lot along the way as we\u2019ve built out our first use case and put together the broader roadmap for Simplify. \\n\\n\\n\\n* **Start narrow:** You could say we took a slight deviation from the well-traveled starting point of ingesting all our components into the Software Catalog. One of our core problems was that,  in order to scale asynchronously, documentation had to be a core citizen in software. We had 80+ microsites of various quality housing technical documentations and it was very difficult to find things. Our primary audience was new joiners with metrics around making onboarding as self-serve as possible. Though we had to veer away from the TechDocs feature to get there, we\u2019ve seen big improvements in the time-to-10th commit metric in particular. \\n\\n* **Keep your brand in mind:** We struggled in that some of the design composability needs we had weren\u2019t well-built in open source yet. TELUS has a very strong brand and to get Simplify on-brand, we had to contort the Backstage UI to meet our brand standards. Generally, we believe branding your Backstage app is an adoption best practice and recommend bringing product design resources in from the beginning to ensure you\u2019re creating something that will build a sense of internal ownership and enthusiasm in your org. \\n\\n* **Don\u2019t be afraid of plugins:** Perhaps because we started working with Backstage _so early_, we ended up building out some custom features that \u2014 as of the 1.0 version \u2014 are no longer needed. In early 2022, we actually hit the reset button and rebuilt our implementation from the ground up to take better advantage of the current options including many plugins that didn\u2019t exist when we started. What has been incredible is that we were able to do this reset very quickly, without losing any of the fantastic documentation we had. We are now better positioned to incorporate new plugins and even more easily contribute our plugins back to the community.\\n\\nThere\u2019s still a lot of work ahead for Simplify and we\u2019re excited to share upcoming milestones and wins with the Backstage community."},{"id":"/backstagecon-kubecon-2022","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/backstagecon-kubecon-2022","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/backstagecon-kubecon-2022/index.md","source":"@site/blog/backstagecon-kubecon-2022/index.md","title":"ICYMI: BackstageCon & KubeCon NA 2022 Recap","description":"We had a great time in Detroit!

Let\u2019s see what the community was up to:\\n\\n### BackstageCon: A full day of nothing but Backstage\\n\\n![Backstagecon group](backstagecon_image.jpg)\\n\\nWe started the week off strong, packing a ballroom for [BackstageCon](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/backstagecon-north-america/) on Monday. It was a smorgasbord of some of our active community members at the first official Backstage conference \u2014 as well as some new faces interested in learning more about Backstage! To welcome us, Roadie\u2019s [Martina Iglesias Fernandez](https://github.com/martina-if) and Spotify\u2019s [Suzanne Daniels](https://github.com/suuus) took center stage. Next up, we listened to three keynotes from the event\u2019s top sponsors: Roadie\u2019s [David Tuite](https://github.com/dtuite) enlightened us on how to 10x developer effectiveness for teams, [Dave Zolotusky](https://github.com/dzolotusky) from Spotify discussed developer happiness and [announced](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/spotify-r%26d_backstage-devex-activity-6990305201710587904-SnDQ?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) that [Spotify Plugins for Backstage](https://backstage.spotify.com/blog/spotify-plugins-for-backstage/) are launching soon, and [Valentina Alaria](https://www.linkedin.com/in/valentinaalaria/) from VMware Tanzu talked about how to curate the Backstage experience to enable developer velocity. In between some creative snacks (lemon blueberry popcorn, anyone?) and coffee breaks, we heard from adopters including [Telus](https://backstage.spotify.com/blog/building-for-simplicity-TELUS/), [DAZN](https://backstage.spotify.com/blog/adopter-spotlight/dazn/), HP, US Bank, and more on lessons learned through their adoption journeys, we talked about different ways to leverage data within Backstage, and we discussed new ways to customize Backstage for specific adopter needs.\\n\\nYou can watch all the BackstageCon sessions, talks, and keynotes [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLj6h78yzYM2OKySsTuiip3BqmdYZQRnSf)! \\n\\n### Project Meeting: Building a better Backstage together\\n\\n![project meeting image](real_project_meeting.jpeg)\\n\\nThe following day, the Backstage maintainers hosted a lively project meeting, where we engaged with a lot of folks that had been at BackstageCon the day before. Over the course of the meeting, the Backstage community talked through recommended approaches for maintaining your Software Catalog as a source of truth, sourcing internal contributors for organization\u2019s Backstage apps, improving frontend performance in a few plugins, how Backstage maintainers work, and appreciation for the contributions from our community. You can read more detailed notes from the project meeting in the repo [here](https://github.com/backstage/community/blob/main/project-meetings/kubecon-na-2022.md).\\n\\n### KubeCon: Demos, swag, and standing-room only\\n\\nAnd last but not least: three days of [KubeCon North America](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america/)! At KubeCon, the Backstage team meeted and greeted so many new faces at our kiosk in the Project Pavilion. We ran demos, answered questions, and handed out lots and lots of SWAG!\\n\\n![maintainer presentation](project_meeting.jpg)\\n\\nSpotify\u2019s [Francesco Corti](https://github.com/fcorti) and core maintainer [Ben Lambert](https://github.com/benjdlambert) took the stage on Wednesday to present the Backstage maintainer talk to a PACKED audience. They discussed how core features of Backstage are changing the way end-user developers interact and manage their ecosystem, and encouraged folks to create the future of developer experience with the rest of the Backstage community. If you missed it, no worries! Their talk track will be posted on the [CNCF YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/cloudnativefdn).\\n\\n\u2026and that\u2019s a wrap! What an incredible week. Our growing Backstage community continues to amaze us with its dedication and enthusiasm. We can\u2019t wait to see you all again at KubeCon Europe in The Netherlands! In fact, we\u2019d love to see our adopters give Backstage talks next year (hint, hint).

More than 90 people joined the event to talk about all things Backstage and we wanted to share our notes in case you missed it. \ud83d\udcd3\ud83d\udcdd\ud83d\udcce\\n\\nEight topics were discussed over the course of the two-hour event with each topic proposed and selected by event attendees. The selected topics were:\\n\\n- How to keep Backstage up-to-date\\n- How to use Backstage to catalog monolithic services\\n- How to use the Homepage plugin and what to use it for\\n- How to grow TechDocs adoption\\n- How to model systems and domains in Backstage\\n- How to let multiple teams contribute functionality to Backstage\\n- How to do ingestion integration testing with Backstage (live demo!)\\n- How to convince your InfoSec team that it is safe to connect Backstage to internal systems.\\n\\nOnce the top topics were upvoted, we divided into smaller discussion groups where we could dig in on each one.\\n\\n![Backstage Unconference March 3](unconference-tracks.png)\\n\\n### **Takeaways**\\n\\nThe [Roadie](https://roadie.io) team was on hand throughout to note significant takeaways or discussion points. Below are some of the key things we picked out.\\n\\n#### **Using the Homepage plugin**\\n\\n- The cards people are using on the homepage include items for:\\n  - Recently visited entities\\n  - Favorite entities\\n  - A \u201cGetting Started guide\u201d for a first time Backstage user\\n  - A company news feed\\n- There is ongoing discussion about how to customize the homepage. For example, should each end user have power over their own homepage layout or should it be set the same for every user?\\n- Some teams are organizing their homepage around the question \u201cWhat should I work on today?\u201d while others are targeting \u201cI\u2019m new here\u2026how do I get to X?\u201d\\n\\n#### **Modeling systems and domains**\\n\\n- There was a general question around how to use domains as a concept\\n- Systems are composable so they offer more flexibility. Domains are more uncertain. For example, there is confusion around whether they should be \u201cvertical\u201d based on a particular product that the company offers or \u201chorizontal\u201d based on a role that might exist in multiple teams.\\n- People wondered if domains within domains could make sense.\\n- People would love if dependencies between components could be worked out automatically\\n- There was an idea to use dependencies as an information feed for Tech Insights. For example, if you know that Service A depends on Service B, and service B has a problem, we could theoretically use Tech Insights to highlight that Service A has a problematic dependency.\\n\\nIn order to try and address some of the questions raised, we\'ve published a guide to [modeling systems in Backstage](https://roadie.io/blog/modelling-software-backstage/).\\n\\n#### **Adopting TechDocs**\\n\\n- For some companies, the biggest friction point for TechDocs is getting everyone to add the techdocs-cli build step to their pipeline. For others, this is a non-issue since they have injection points in every CI where they can add functionality.\\n- Exporting to markdown from Confluence doesn\u2019t really work. They have too much custom markup and too many widgets. Exporting from Notion works better since it exports clean markdown.\\n\\n#### **Convincing your InfoSec team**\\n\\n- Putting Backstage behind the VPN is an obvious security choice, but it introduces friction for people who are trying to use Backstage and some orgs don\u2019t want to do it for that reason.\\n- For Backstage to be successful, you need large scale adoption so friction minimization should be prioritized.\\n\\n### **Thank you!**\\n\\nThe organizers wish to say thank you to everyone who attended and helped to make this event special. An Unconference is only as good as the community serves, and the Backstage community has shown itself to be an enthusiastic and welcoming space once again.\\n\\nThank you to the Backstage team at Spotify for announcing the event in the official Backstage community newsletter.\\n\\nLastly, thank you to [Martina](https://github.com/martina-if) from Roadie and [Jorge](https://github.com/jorgelainfiesta) from [Frontside](https://frontside.com/) for organizing and hosting the event. Herding 90+ people to simultaneously suggest and vote on topics is no small feat, and this event went down smoothly thanks to your efforts.\\n\\n### **See you next time**\\n\\nWe plan to have a Backstage Unconference approximately once per quarter going forward. You can expect the next one to happen some time in July.\\n\\nTo find out when the next one is happening, make sure you\u2019re subscribed to [Roadie\'s Backstage Weekly](https://roadie.io/backstage-weekly/) and the [official Backstage community newsletter](https://info.backstage.spotify.com/newsletter_subscribe)."},{"id":"/backstage-turns-2","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/backstage-turns-2","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/backstage-turns-2/index.md","source":"@site/blog/backstage-turns-2/index.md","title":"Backstage Turns Two!","description":"Happy second birthday Backstage!

Of course, this is software, so we expect things to move fast. But when you have a passionate, worldwide community building together, we\u2019ve now seen firsthand just how fast that can be. We\u2019re marking our second year as a community by becoming a CNCF incubating project, reaching 100 public adopters, releasing version 1.0 of the core app, and other very nice birthday gifts. Rather than a toddler finding their feet, Backstage today is beginning to look awfully grown-up for a two-year-old.\\n\\n## Out of the Sandbox and into Incubation\\n\\nTwo years ago, a small team at Spotify launched Backstage into open source during our internal Hack Week. We knew we had something special on our hands and that Backstage could potentially be the most ambitious open source project in Spotify\u2019s history (you can listen to me wax philosophical on this topic more in [Episode 2 of the new NerdOut@Spotify podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/332yTwGiILGKTS7dsHCj2P?si=pX9xTzB2SgmsROdlLLr24A).)\\n\\nWhen Spotify donated the project to the CNCF, we saw it as the first promising step toward making Backstage an industry standard. As the home to Kubernetes, Envoy, and so many other game-changing open technologies, the CNCF and its community has had a wide-ranging impact on the daily lives of developers everywhere. And that\u2019s what we hoped for Backstage, even back then.\\n\\nBut we couldn\'t have envisioned where we\u2019d be two years later \u2014 part of an ever-growing community of people that feel as passionate as we do about unlocking better developer experience for every engineering organization.\\n\\nYesterday, the CNCF announced that its [Technical Oversight Committee](https://github.com/cncf/toc) (TOC) voted to accept Backstage as a [CNCF incubating project](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2022/03/15/backstage-project-joins-the-cncf-incubator/). The move from the CNCF Sandbox to Incubation is an important step forward for the project\u2019s technical governance.\\n\\nIt\u2019s also recognition for all the work the Backstage open source community has done to advance and grow this project since we launched the repo on GitHub just a few weeks after that Hack Week. We still have a long way to go to becoming the standard, but moving out of the CNCF Sandbox and beginning the Incubation phase is further validation of those aspirations.\\n\\n## What do retailers, gaming studios, banks, airlines, streamers, startups, and enterprise software makers all have in common?\\n\\nDevelopers, developers, developers \u2014 that\u2019s what all companies have in common. Developers dealing with [more complexity](https://youtu.be/85TQEpNCaU0) than they\u2019ve ever had to deal with before. Developers who want to be able to go from idea to bug fix or feature faster.\\n\\nTwo years in, the Backstage ecosystem has grown by leaps and bounds. More than 5,000 contributors have joined the project and are submitting bugs, adding new features, and building valuable plugins that benefit the greater community. From [Expedia Group](https://backstage.spotify.com/blog/measuring-backstage-proof-of-value-at-expedia/) (adopter No.18) to Unity (adopter No.67), Backstage now has [100 publicly listed adopters](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/ADOPTERS.md) across a variety of industries, including retail, gaming, financial services, manufacturing, and government.\\n\\nWe have companies like [Roadie](http://roadie.io) providing hosting solutions and ThoughtWorks [providing technology and consulting services](https://www.thoughtworks.com/en-us/about-us/news/2021/thoughtworks-is-collaborating-with-spotify-to-deliver-better-dev) to teams looking to stand up Backstage in their own orgs. We\u2019re starting to see more and more job listings for Backstage developers which tells us that companies of all shapes and sizes are going all-in on Backstage and developer effectiveness.\\n\\nAlso, I\u2019ll pause now to give a special shoutout to our early adopters. They stuck with us through all the bumps and breaking changes. But because of their early commitment, we now see instances of Backstage up and running in so many different kinds of engineering organizations. From [Zalando](https://youtu.be/6sg5uMCLxTA) to [American Airlines](https://backstage.spotify.com/blog/adopter-spotlight/american-airlines-runway/) and [Brex](https://backstage.spotify.com/blog/community-session/11-brex-backstage-upgrade-helper/), the growing pains of our earliest adopters helped pave the way for smoother adoptions for all who follow them.\\n\\nA few more numbers that make us proud:\\n\\n- 2,000+ project forks\\n- 20,000+ commits\\n- 10,000+ PRs & issues\\n- 15,000+ stars on GitHub\\n- 60+ open source plugins in the [Backstage Plugin Marketplace](https://backstage.io/plugins)\\n\\n## A global community of friendly, helpful contributors\\n\\nWe open sourced Backstage in March 2020 and then almost immediately went into lockdown. When you think about this project in the context of the pandemic, it\'s really remarkable how much this community has been able to achieve.\\n\\nThe Backstage community is truly global with adopters and contributors from almost every continent (sorry, Antarctica!) coming together to share what they\u2019ve worked on and demo cool stuff in our monthly Community Sessions. The repo and the Discord server truly never sleep as a growing group of dedicated Backstage experts outside Spotify support one another and offer help 24/7.\\n\\nWe asked a few contributors and maintainers to share their thoughts around this two-year milestone.\\n\\n<youtube title=\\"Backstage Turns Two!\\" url=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-j-waaybcH0\\">\\n</youtube>\\n\\nWarms the heart, doesn\u2019t it? Thanks again to all our contributors for making this possible. Seriously. We\u2019re proud of what the community has accomplished and how we\u2019ve accomplished it. All along, it\u2019s your enthusiasm and warm/collaborative/positive vibes that have carried us and this project through.\\n\\n## Version 1.0 and beyond\\n\\nTomorrow, we\u2019ll be releasing version 1.0 of the Backstage core framework, including Software Catalog, Software Templates, TechDocs, and API Reference. With Backstage 1.0, the project\u2019s core components are coming out of beta and into production with regular versioning and release cycle commitments (check back on this blog for more details!).\\n\\nv1.0 paves the way for more adoption, a bigger community, more contributions \u2014 and with this continued growth in the ecosystem, we expect even greater innovation on the platform just on the horizon with exchange of features and plugins.\\n\\nWhat comes next for Backstage is \u2014 in many ways \u2014 entirely up to you. We are looking to this community to [help us shape the next year](https://backstage.io/docs/overview/roadmap).\\n\\nIf you\u2019re already a part of this community, thank you for your hard work and dedication. Backstage wouldn\u2019t be where it is today without you. We\u2019ve come a long way together, but there\u2019s still so much to do.\\n\\nAnd if you haven\u2019t signed up yet, there\u2019s plenty of room on this party boat! And there\u2019s never been a better time to hop on board.

Today, we\u2019re releasing a report from an independent security audit and the first version of the Backstage Threat Model.\\n\\nAs an [Incubating project](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2022/03/15/backstage-project-joins-the-cncf-incubator/) within the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)](https://www.cncf.io/), Backstage was fortunate enough to take advantage of a sponsored security audit. The [Open Source Technology Improvement Fund (OSTIF)](https://ostif.org/) sponsored the audit as part of its ongoing efforts to secure the open source software ecosystem, and the audit itself was performed by [X41 D-Sec](https://x41-dsec.de/). Our goal with the audit was to evaluate and improve Backstage\u2019s security posture, focusing on the core Backstage framework and plugins.\\n\\n\\n## Report Findings and Fixes\\n\\nThe security audit and improvements concluded earlier this month, on August 18th.  The audit **findings** totalled two critical, two high, five medium, and three low severity vulnerabilities, alongside 15 side findings with no direct security impact. As of the [Backstage 1.5 release](https://backstage.io/docs/releases/v1.5.0), eight out of the 12 main findings and many of the side findings are fully remedied. If you are a few versions behind there\u2019s no need to worry though, most fixes were included in the 1.3 release.\\n\\nOut of the four findings that have yet to be fixed, three are related to rate limiting or internal DoS concerns. With the introduction of the Backstage Threat Model (more on that below), Backstage\u2019s positioning states that this is outside the scope of the security concerns of Backstage. Rather, we trust internal users of Backstage to not intentionally sabotage the availability of the service. This is not to say that we will never aim to get these findings addressed, but we have pushed them to be potential future improvements as we focus our near-term efforts on improving the product in other ways.\\n\\nThe last outstanding finding is to build out the capabilities of our service-to-service auth system. This is an area where the audit identified a couple of missing pieces in our early version of the implementation. We have since closed the gap by introducing token expiration, and will continue to work on this as we open up for more complex and hardened deployment patterns through the [evolution of the backend system](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/issues/11611).\\n\\nAnother important finding was the potential for confusion and user impersonation due to most authentication providers having sign-in enabled by default. This finding reinforced our decision to switch sign-in to being disabled by default for all authentication providers, which was part of the [1.1 release](https://backstage.io/docs/releases/v1.1.0).\\n\\nPerhaps the most important outcome of this audit is that it helped us focus our efforts to keep improving the security of Backstage. It identified priority areas in both implementation and documentation for us going forward. One particular area that was pointed out in a finding is the documentation around the security model of Backstage deployment. There have been several efforts to highlight this in documentation, but it is still not clear enough. What we\u2019ve been lacking is documentation that is completely dedicated towards detailing the security concerns of Backstage. That is why in addition to publishing the security audit report, we are also introducing the [Backstage Threat Model](https://backstage.io/docs/overview/threat-model).\\n\\n## Introducing the Backstage Threat Model\\n\\nThe existing Backstage documentation has many security concerns interwoven within its text, but to find them all, you need to spend a lot of time reading. We previously lacked a one-stop-shop for readers that are interested in the security model and concerns of Backstage. So, we are happy to introduce the [Backstage Threat Model](https://backstage.io/docs/overview/threat-model), which closes this gap. The Threat Model outlines key security considerations for operators, developers, and security researchers. It is a living document that will evolve and expand alongside the Backstage project.\\n\\nThe threat model document covers the trust model and roles involved in a typical Backstage setup, the responsibilities that fall on integrators of Backstage, and common configuration concerns across all Backstage projects. Beyond these three topics, it also dives deeper into a number of core features. The `auth`, `catalog`, `scaffolder`, and `techdocs` plugins are all covered separately with their individual security concerns.\\n\\nWe\u2019d like to point out a few key parts in case you are in a rush. Be sure to familiarize yourself with the integrator\'s responsibility to protect the Backstage installation from unauthorized access. If you ingest organizational data into the catalog and use that to sign in users, you\u2019ll also want to check out the first halves of the authentication and catalog sections.\\n\\n## Links and References\\n\\n- [Full Audit Report](https://backstage.io/blog/assets/22-08-23/X41-Backstage-Audit-2022.pdf)\\n- [Backstage Threat Model](https://backstage.io/docs/overview/threat-model)\\n- [Backstage Security Policy](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/SECURITY.md)\\n\\nOn behalf of the Backstage maintainers and community: thanks to the CNCF, OSTIF, and X41 D-Sec for the opportunity to improve the project."},{"id":"/backstage-homepage-templates","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/backstage-homepage-templates","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/backstage-homepage-templates/index.md","source":"@site/blog/backstage-homepage-templates/index.md","title":"Say hi to Backstage homepage templates!","description":"We\u2019re excited to announce the arrival of homepage templates.

It can be intimidating to build up your own instance of Backstage, so we decided to make your life a bit easier by giving you an out-of-the-box homepage to hit the ground running. This template can be found in our [Backstage Storybook](https://backstage.io/storybook/?path=/story/plugins-home-templates--default-template), as well as future templates that we build.\\n\\n## Why homepage templates?\\n\\nAt Spotify, the Backstage homepage is one of the most commonly used pages, primarily leveraged to quickly find and easily access things. Most of our users start off their Backstage experience on the homepage to quickly pivot to their intended destination. For example, folks generally prefer having a search bar available for quickly finding what they are looking for. Backstage users at Spotify also prefer having a central toolkit for navigating to tools that exist within the organization and for accessing their favorite entities and documentation pages.\\n\\n![Backstage homepage at Spotify](./spotify-backstage-homepage.png)\\n\\nBut we also know that all organizations look different and have different needs. Backstage is designed with this in mind, and so is the homepage plugin. You can modify and customize your version of the Home plugin so it fits with your needs. Sometimes customizing and configuring your app can be overwhelming to get started, with the [homepage templates](https://backstage.io/storybook/?path=/story/plugins-home-templates--default-template) and components we can provide recommendations and guidelines to make adoption of Backstage more streamlined and simplified.\\n\\n## What are homepage templates?\\n\\nA homepage template is just a template of what a homepage can look like. You can either copy it as a whole, or pick different components from it to use. The homepage templates live in our [Backstage Storybook](https://backstage.io/storybook/) and we hope to see this collection grow with contributions from you all. If you don\u2019t want to use one of the templates, you can pick and choose from our collection of [homepage components](https://backstage.io/storybook/?path=/story/plugins-home-components) that you can use right out of the box and compose your own homepage. We\u2019ve included the [SearchBar](https://backstage.io/storybook/?path=/story/plugins-home-components-searchbar--custom-styles), [CompanyLogo](https://backstage.io/storybook/?path=/story/plugins-home-components-companylogo--custom-logo) and [Toolkit](https://backstage.io/storybook/?path=/story/plugins-home-components-toolkit--default) components in our Backstage Storybook as of today. In the future, we plan on open sourcing the widely popular QuickAccess card, which includes Favorites, Frequently Visited, and Recently Visited options.\\n\\n![Composed Backstage homepage](./composed-backstage-homepage.png \'Composed homepage for the app using the default homepage template\')\\n\\n![Example of default homepage template](./default-homepage-template.png \'Example of the default homepage template in Backstage Storybook\')\\n\\n## How to get started\\n\\nTo get started, you first need to set up your homepage plugin in the app if you have not already, then you can move on to composing your homepage. You can find our step-by-step documentation of how to do this under the [App Configuration - Customize the look-and-feel of your App documentation](https://backstage.io/docs/getting-started/app-custom-theme#custom-homepage). You can also access the [Backstage UI Kit in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/nUaAw56hTgC0RIOYkuLSrB/Backstage-Design-System?node-id=2185%3A2978) to duplicate your own version and play around with a fitting homepage for your own organization.\\n\\n![Example of homepage components in the Backstage UI Kit in Figma](./homepage-components-figma.png \'Example of the homepage components in the Backstage UI Kit in Figma\')\\n\\n## What\u2019s next?\\n\\nSome future templates that we have in mind are more dashboard-esque ones that display a variety of relevant data for your organization. We will also open source more homepage components such as [Starred Entities](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/issues/6906) that you can use when you are composing your components.\\n\\n## How to contribute\\n\\nAs mentioned above, we would love to build out these collections of both homepage components and homepage templates, so if you would like to contribute, please check out our [contribution documentation](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/plugins/home/README.md#contributing) to get started."},{"id":"/backstage-1.0","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/backstage-1.0","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/backstage-1.0/index.md","source":"@site/blog/backstage-1.0/index.md","title":"New release: Backstage 1.0","description":"If you\u2019ve been waiting for Backstage to come out of beta, Backstage 1.0 is here!

Now hundreds of adopters are using Backstage as the single pane of glass for their core development, managing millions of components and technical documentation, and helping hundreds of thousands of developers be more productive and happy.\\n\\nThis milestone demonstrates Backstage\u2019s maturity and the incredible effort from the core maintainers, contributors, and adopters. In a short time, we\u2019ve seen a global community grow rapidly with people bringing their passion to this project and our goal of empowering developers. Because, yes, this is also your goal and your time to celebrate.\\n\\n## So what is Backstage 1.0?\\n\\nIf you\u2019re thinking \u201cwhat is Backstage 1.0, and what does it include?\u201d You\u2019re not alone, so let\u2019s get into it.\\n\\nTo start, let\u2019s define Backstage: it\u2019s an open platform for building developer portals, mainly defined by a set of libraries together with plugins that can be added, removed, or customized so that the final behavior of the developer portal product is what an adopter wants. For the past two years, the open source platform has been in beta. With Backstage 1.0, we\'re coming out of beta and into production with regular versioning and release cycle commitments. So, if your company requires production-ready software, you can now use Backstage and join [over 100 other public adopters](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/ADOPTERS.md)!\\n\\nOur definition of Backstage 1.0 includes:\\n\\n- Backstage Core 1.0 libraries as the set of libraries to make the platform work\\n- [Backstage Software Catalog](https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-catalog/software-catalog-overview) 1.0\\n- [Backstage Software Templates](https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-templates/software-templates-index) 1.0\\n- [Backstage TechDocs](https://backstage.io/docs/features/techdocs/techdocs-overview) 1.0\\n\\nComing soon: [Backstage Search](https://backstage.io/docs/features/search/search-overview) 1.0 will be included in the near future as part of the regular releases to the Backstage platform.\\n\\nIn terms of features, the maintainers will not be shipping new stuff as part of the major release but instead:\\n\\n- Refactoring the code packaging to better reflect the release numbering\\n- Removal of deprecated services to reduce the risk of introducing breaking changes\\n- Establishing clarity on the release lifecycle, numbering, and cadence as well as the support model\\n- Improvements to Backstage.io documentation\\n\\n## The road ahead\\n\\nIn terms of maturity and stability, the road ahead for Backstage is bright and busy. The goal is to bring Backstage to the next level of maturity and continue improving it, according to adopter growth, feature set, and identified use cases.\\n\\nYou can read more about Backstage\u2019s roadmap [here](https://backstage.io/docs/overview/roadmap), but in terms of maturity and stability we would like to highlight the following:\\n\\n- CNCF incubation: The Backstage project [recently moved from Sandbox to Incubation](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2022/03/15/backstage-project-joins-the-cncf-incubator/) phase within the [CNCF maturity levels](https://www.cncf.io/projects/#:~:text=Maturity%20levels,should%20be%20adopting%20different%20projects.).\\n- Security auditing and strategy: With the CNCF\u2019s support, the project maintainers are working on a security audit initiative to make the platform more secure and will share more details soon. The audit is part of an overall security strategy being developed this quarter.\\n- Paid plugins for advanced and enterprise use cases: Last year, [Spotify announced its work on paid plugins](https://backstage.spotify.com/blog/paid-plugins-announcement/) built on top of the Backstage open source platform. This is another example of the platform\u2019s maturity and Spotify\u2019s continued commitment to the project, with a focus on customers and use cases requiring enterprise-focused support and plugins developed and proven by Spotify.\\n\\n## Some links to peruse\\n\\nIf you want to know more about this first major release, check out the following links to learn more about this release effort and receive support.\\n\\n- [Release notes](https://backstage.io/docs/releases/v1.0.0) and [Changelog](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/releases/tag/v1.0.0).\\n- [Backstage official documentation](https://backstage.io/docs/) and [backstage.spotify.com](https://backstage.spotify.com/).\\n- [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/backstage-687207715902193673).\\n- [Backstage repository on GitHub](https://github.com/backstage/backstage).\\n- [List of public adopters](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/ADOPTERS.md)."},{"id":"/avoid-upgrade-surprises-with-backstage-upgrade-helper","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/avoid-upgrade-surprises-with-backstage-upgrade-helper","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/avoid-upgrade-surprises-with-backstage-upgrade-helper/index.md","source":"@site/blog/avoid-upgrade-surprises-with-backstage-upgrade-helper/index.md","title":"Avoid upgrade surprises with Backstage Upgrade Helper","description":"Learn about Backstage Upgrade Helper and how it can help you keep your application up-to-date in a simple way.","date":"2023-07-13T12:03:52.889Z","formattedDate":"July 13, 2023","tags":[],"readingTime":3.935,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Vincenzo Scamporlino, Spotify"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Avoid upgrade surprises with Backstage Upgrade Helper","description":"Learn about Backstage Upgrade Helper and how it can help you keep your application up-to-date in a simple way.","author":"Vincenzo Scamporlino, Spotify","publishedISODate":"2022-03-04T01:00:00","previewImage":"./preview.png"},"prevItem":{"title":"New release: Backstage 1.0","permalink":"/blog/backstage-1.0"},"nextItem":{"title":"What\u2019s happening with Backstage permissions and authorization","permalink":"/blog/authorization-framework-rfc"}},"content":"_Note: This post was originally published on [Backstage.io](https://backstage.io/blog/2022/03/04/backstage-upgrade-helper)._\\n\\n![Backstage header](./backstage-upgrade-helper-header.png)\\n\\n_TLDR;_ The Spotify team recently announced [Backstage Upgrade Helper](https://backstage.github.io/upgrade-helper): a tool that helps adopters keep their Backstage application up-to-date. **Spoiler alert**: this is also a hidden and heartwarming tale about the beauty of open source innovation.\\n\\n## Upgrading Backstage was a common pain point\\n\\nWithout a doubt, one of the most exciting things about Backstage is our community. Step into our daily [Discord conversations](https://discord.gg/backstage-687207715902193673) and the monthly [Community Sessions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMQYSTKAx0) and you\u2019ll find a ton of great ideas, problem-solving, and support for one another.\\n\\nDuring one of these discussions, we realized we all shared the same pain point \u2014 upgrading a Backstage application.\\n\\nThe Backstage open source project is in hyper-growth mode, where dozens of pull requests are merged each day. This means adopters need to go through the upgrade process more often in order to get the latest and greatest features. The Spotify team heard a lot of feedback about how painful and manual this process was \u2014 so we decided to tackle this problem during one of our internal Hack Days.\\n\\nAt Spotify, we run Hack Days every month and a lot of ideas come from those sessions (in fact, the idea to open source Backstage itself [was born on a Hack Day](https://open.spotify.com/episode/332yTwGiILGKTS7dsHCj2P)!). During a brainstorming session, we noticed that another open source community faced a similar upgrading problem years back and came up with a really good solution.\\n\\nIf you have ever worked on a React Native project, you might immediately recognize what we are referring to: The [React Native Upgrade Helper](https://github.com/react-native-community/upgrade-helper) \u2014 a web tool to support React Native developers in upgrading their apps \u2014 might have saved hours of your time. It certainly saved us hours of ours. So we looked into the project details and discovered it could fulfill our Backstage needs.\\n\\nWe started by creating a fork from React Native\u2019s open source project, applying a few changes on top of it to introduce Backstage support, and \u2014 _ecco_ \u2014 we had a new Backstage Upgrade Helper! In just a few days with pretty minimal effort, we created a product that would save a lot of time for the entire Backstage community. And we had fun at the same time (happy developers make happy code \ud83d\ude01 ).\\n\\n## So what is Backstage Upgrade Helper?\\n\\nThe Backstage Upgrade Helper tool enables adopters to easily upgrade their Backstage app by using the power of git to create a diff between different versions.\\n\\nWhenever a new version of Backstage is released, the Helper scaffolds a new dummy Backstage app using the `backstage-create-app` cli utility and checks all the generated files in a specific git branch. After the branch is generated, it gets compared with all the existing ones, which results in generating specific git patches stored in specific files. By selecting the version of the current Backstage release together with the version you want to upgrade to, the UI knows which patch file needs to be picked up.\\n\\nSo, now you can update your Backstage application in three steps rather than manually reading the changelogs of all the Backstage modules in reverse order.\\n\\n### To use the Upgrade Helper, follow these simple steps\\n\\n1. Go to the [Backstage Upgrade Helper](https://backstage.github.io/upgrade-helper) and enter your current release and the release you would like to upgrade to.\\n\\n2. Press **Show me how to upgrade!** After that, the feature spits out the changes between the two Backstage versions in a split-screen view for easy comparison.\\n\\n   ![Backstage Upgrade Helper in action](./backstage-upgrade-helper.gif)\\n\\n3. Apply the suggested changes to your source code to correctly upgrade your app to the selected Backstage version. This will let you directly migrate from the version you\u2019re currently using to the target version and skip all the intermediate steps you would have otherwise gone through manually reading all the changelogs.\\n\\n[Watch the Upgrade Helper demo](https://youtu.be/nYjI2j-lWEM?t=410).\\n\\n## Open source inspires\\n\\nThus far, the Backstage Upgrade Helper has gotten a lot of good feedback from the community and we\u2019re sure to see awesome contributions in the future. But all the credit behind this idea goes to the React Native community.\\n\\nWith React Native\u2019s open source contributions, we were able to quickly solve a tough problem for the entire Backstage community. Not only did React Native\u2019s project save us time creating a new product, but it has also saved our adopters time upgrading Backstage.\\n\\nThis is why we love working in open source. The hard work done for one community has the power to influence and inspire another community. We hope Backstage can do the same and pay it forward to other open source projects.\\n\\nFor more Backstage Upgrade Helper resources, check out the [UI code](https://github.com/backstage/upgrade-helper) and the [git patches](https://github.com/backstage/upgrade-helper-diff)."},{"id":"/authorization-framework-rfc","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/authorization-framework-rfc","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/authorization-framework-rfc/index.md","source":"@site/blog/authorization-framework-rfc/index.md","title":"What\u2019s happening with Backstage permissions and authorization","description":"We want to build a flexible authorization framework that supports a wide variety of authorization methods, including RBAC (role-based access control).","date":"2023-07-13T12:03:52.870Z","formattedDate":"July 13, 2023","tags":[],"readingTime":2.19,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Adam Stevenson, Spotify"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"What\u2019s happening with Backstage permissions and authorization","description":"We want to build a flexible authorization framework that supports a wide variety of authorization methods, including RBAC (role-based access control).","author":"Adam Stevenson, Spotify","publishedISODate":"2021-10-25","previewImage":"./preview.png","featured":false},"prevItem":{"title":"Avoid upgrade surprises with Backstage Upgrade Helper","permalink":"/blog/avoid-upgrade-surprises-with-backstage-upgrade-helper"},"nextItem":{"title":"Where do you start when adopting Backstage?","permalink":"/blog/adopting-backstage"}},"content":"![Authorization illustration showing configuration sliders and padlocks](./authorization-rfc-header.png)\\n\\n**TL;DR** The Spotify team has published an [authorization framework RFC][rfc] in the Backstage GitHub repository which is open for feedback until Friday, November 5. Read on for more information about our approach and future plans for authorization.\\n\\n## Our proposal for an open, flexible authorization framework\\n\\nWith Halloween just around the corner, we thought it would be a great time to talk about something that always has admins spooked: authorization.\\n\\nWhile Backstage adopters and contributors bring so many different perspectives and organizational challenges, authorization has emerged as a common need \u2014 even an outright blocker to adoption \u2014 frequently requested by the community.\\n\\nBackstage has many different _authentication_ methods, but the project currently lacks built-in ways to _authorize_ access to specific data, APIs, or interface actions \u2014 these are all visible to any authenticated user.\\n\\nWe\u2019ve heard Backstage adopters share a broad range of authorization requirements: implementations like role-based access control (RBAC), attribute-based access control (ABAC), bespoke logic expressed in code, or integration with external authorization providers.\\n\\nOur core belief is Backstage\u2019s power stems from its flexibility and customization, so any authorization system should allow for many different authorization mechanisms. Today we\u2019ve published an authorization framework RFC in the Backstage GitHub repository that addresses permissions and authorization within a Backstage application, which we believe provides this flexibility. We\u2019d love your feedback so please comment early and often \u2014 the [RFC][rfc] will be open until Friday, November 5.\\n\\n## Our plans for a Spotify-built RBAC plugin\\n\\nIn between exploring Swedish archipelagoes (well, some of us), the Spotify team spent the summer with community members talking about RBAC and the need to make configuration powerful yet understandable. We learned a lot and are in active development of an RBAC plugin for Backstage \u2014 which will build on the proposed authorization framework.\\n\\nHowever, unlike previous plugin contributions, **Spotify will retain ownership of our RBAC plugin and will license it under different terms**. To be clear, we\u2019re not backing away from core contributions. We believe the proposed open source authorization framework is suitable for many different permissions needs (but if you disagree, again please comment away in the RFC). We want people to build what works best for them. And we believe our RBAC solution will be a great option among other authorization mechanisms.\\n\\nOur goal is to be as transparent as possible with this community so we will be sharing more details on the plugin development and distribution plan shortly. Feel free to hit us up on [Discord][discord] or in the repo if you have any questions in the meantime.\\n\\n[rfc]: https://github.com/backstage/backstage/pull/7761\\n[discord]: https://discord.gg/backstage-687207715902193673"},{"id":"/adopting-backstage","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/adopting-backstage","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/adopting-backstage/index.md","source":"@site/blog/adopting-backstage/index.md","title":"Where do you start when adopting Backstage?","description":"First consider the three main jobs to be done (create, manage, explore), then the size of your engineering organization.","date":"2023-07-13T12:03:52.850Z","formattedDate":"July 13, 2023","tags":[],"readingTime":9.6,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Austin Lamon, Spotify"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Where do you start when adopting Backstage?","description":"First consider the three main jobs to be done (create, manage, explore), then the size of your engineering organization.","author":"Austin Lamon, Spotify","publishedISODate":"2021-05-20","previewImage":"./preview.png"},"prevItem":{"title":"What\u2019s happening with Backstage permissions and authorization","permalink":"/blog/authorization-framework-rfc"},"nextItem":{"title":"Adopter Spotlight: Toyota revs up secure app development with Backstage and AWS","permalink":"/blog/adopter-spotlight-toyota"}},"content":"_Note: This post was originally published on [Backstage.io](https://backstage.io/blog/2021/05/20/adopting-backstage)._\\n\\n![Create, Manage, Explore](create-manage-explore.gif)\\n\\nOne of the greatest strengths of Backstage also presents a never-ending challenge: Backstage is highly customizable and allows you to easily build a unique developer portal suited to your organization\u2019s needs. The downside of this flexibility is that it can be hard to know where to start. Backstage can do so many things \u2014 integrating every part of your tech infrastructure and developer experience \u2014 but if you set off building a developer portal without a plan, it\u2019s easy to get overwhelmed by all the possibilities. To help you form your plan, this post will detail how Spotify came to design our internal portal and recommend potential models for you to use when designing and building your own.\\n\\n## Infrastructure as tech culture\\n\\nBefore providing recommendations on getting started with Backstage, it\u2019s helpful to have a bit of context as to why Spotify made the design decisions we did. No two companies are identical \u2014 and thus, no two Backstage implementations are the same.\\n\\nRolling back the clock just a few years, [Spotify was challenged](https://engineering.atspotify.com/2021/05/18/a-product-story-the-lessons-of-backstage-and-spotifys-autonomous-culture/) to continue to scale our engineering team (and the number of features and components built) but retain the speed of product development. Some user research with Spotify developers highlighted a clear problem: there was simply too much non-documented institutional knowledge needed to get things done. No one could find anything and everyone was interrupting everyone else trying to figure things out.\\n\\nSpotify\u2019s developers were facing three big challenges on a daily basis:\\n\\n- They not only needed to build software quickly, they also needed to pass along knowledge to new joiners about how best to create new components.\\n- They needed to somehow maintain a mental model of the systems their squad owned. (Or, if they were lucky, they found a hopefully-up-to-date spreadsheet tracking this information.)\\n- They needed to keep an eye on what squads around them might be building to ensure they could reuse systems when they needed to solve similar problems in the future.\\n\\nIn short, Spotify developers needed to continue building industry leading features at breakneck speed, while simultaneously maintaining a mental model for all the software at Spotify (oh, and help every new joiner develop that mental model as well!).\\n\\n\\n## Three jobs: Create, manage, explore\\n\\nAround the same time, the [jobs to be done](https://hbr.org/2016/09/know-your-customers-jobs-to-be-done) framework was becoming popular and luckily, a few Spotifiers helped guide the vision for a _sense-making tool for developers_ toward using it. After user research and many failed attempts, we landed on three jobs Spotify developers needed to do consistently:\\n\\n\\n- **Create**: Spotify developers want to delight their customers with incredible features. They create new software to do that.\\n- **Manage**: Spotify developers are proud of their work and treat their software and data like products. That requires maintaining all the software they own on an ongoing basis.\\n- **Explore**: Spotify developers want to solve new, yet unsolved problems. They try to build on existing systems to help them do that.\\n\\nSo: make software, maintain the software you own throughout its lifecycle, and integrate with other people\u2019s software.\\n\\nWithin today\u2019s complex development environments, there are barriers both big and small that get in the way of those three jobs. Backstage provides the building blocks for removing those barriers, streamlining your development cycle, and letting developers do what they really want to do: build great features. Let\u2019s take a closer look at each of these jobs.\\n\\n![Backstage Software Templates rocket](create.gif)\\n\\n### Create\\n\\n**Job:** You\u2019re an engineer, ready to start building a new microservice. Do you just pick whatever framework you want? How do you reserve capacity to run your service in production? What about managing CI/CD?\\n\\n**Tool:** At Spotify, we use **Backstage Software Templates** to simplify all of this, reducing time\u2013to\u2013Hello World to just a few clicks. Instead of researching Spring Boot versus Helidon, opening a Jira ticket, rummaging through docs, and configuring CI automations, you just choose a template and your project is automatically set up in the repo for you, with the CI already running your first build.\\n\\n**Result:** By making it easier to start new projects, your engineers get to the good part of coding features faster. And your organization\u2019s best practices are built into the templates, encouraging standards and reducing complexity in your tech ecosystem.\\n\\n![Backstage Service Catalog system](manage.gif)\\n\\n### Manage\\n\\n**Job:** You\u2019re on a small team that owns a dozen services. Whenever you update and deploy those services, you\u2019re switching between your CI, the AWS console, a security dashboard, and a CLI so you can try to figure out which Kubernetes cluster your service ended up on. In other words, you have a lot of open windows and tabs, and each step means switching to a new interface.\\n\\n**Tool:** All of your team\u2019s software components are organized together on one page in the **Backstage Service Catalog**. Go to any service\u2019s page from there and its CI/CD status, [Kubernetes deployment status](https://backstage.io/blog/2021/01/12/new-backstage-feature-kubernetes-for-service-owners), documentation, security checks \u2014 and everything else related to that service \u2014 is grouped together in one seamless interface that shows you only the info you want.\\n\\n**Result**: One page in Backstage has everything you need to manage the software you own. No more context-switching. No more digging through your cloud provider\u2019s obscure admin features. Outside the repo and your IDE, everything you need to manage your service is right inside Backstage.\\n\\n![Backstage explorer](explore.gif)\\n\\n### Explore\\n\\n**Job:** You\'re building a new mobile feature that needs to ensure a user is paying for the premium version of your product \u2014 but someone must\u2019ve already built a library that handles that, right? A company-wide email and a few calls for help on Slack yield no response, so you resign yourself to building the capability yourself. Turns out someone did build the library you needed. They were just on vacation so they didn\u2019t see your messages. How do you enable better discovery and collaboration across your org?\\n\\n**Tools:** At Spotify, anyone can find everyone else\u2019s software \u2014 because everything is centralized inside Backstage, organized by the **Backstage Service Catalog** and accessible by **search**. Go to any library or services page, and you\u2019ll find the owners and documentation, even its API and how to extend it if need be.\\n\\n**Result:** One place for everything, one place to search. Developers can more easily share components, build on top of each other\u2019s work, and discover tools, libraries, frameworks, documentation, system designs, org charts, and more.\\n\\n## Sounds great. Where do I start?\\n\\nAfter talking with companies who have already adopted Backstage, we\u2019ve seen a few common strategies for getting started. The different strategies are based on the size of your engineering org (which often also corresponds with how fast you\u2019re growing).\\n\\n![200 engineers](200-engineers.png)\\n\\n\\n\\n### My org has ~200 engineers (and is growing fast)\\n\\nYou\u2019re big enough to start feeling the pain, and only getting bigger. Onboarding and discoverability are your biggest challenges.\\n\\n**Pain points:**\\n\\n- This size seems to be the tipping point \u2014 where complexity is taking hold, collaboration starts breaking down, and ad hoc solutions stop working.\\n- Often this is also when you\u2019re growing so fast (doubling in size every 6\u201312 months) that there are now more new engineers than old engineers.\\n- New engineers can\u2019t find anything, so they ask around, which pulls all your other engineers off-task with interruptions.\\n- Logjams form. One company told us how it was taking 3\u20134 days for pull requests to get merged.\\n\\n**Recommendation \u2014 Explore, then create:**\\n\\n- New engineers need an easy way to find out how to do things, so you\u2019re not just adding bodies, you\u2019re adding happy, productive contributors.\\n- To streamline onboarding, start with centralizing your documentation and making your tools and software components discoverable in Backstage.\\n- At this size, you might not have a dedicated platform/infra team in place yet, but Backstage can provide the framework for centralizing and sharing knowledge \u2014 from managing compliance requirements to finding the right API documentation.\\n- This allows both new and old engineers to collaborate more efficiently, easily discover best practices, and cuts down on duplicated work (e.g., a new team doesn\u2019t end up rebuilding a database that already exists but nobody can find).\\n\\n![1,000 engineers](1000-engineers.png)\\n\\n### My org has ~1,000 engineers\\n\\nYou\u2019re officially big. Lots and lots of teams are managing lots and lots of software \u2014 and the frustration of switching between all the various tools to do that is growing exponentially.\\n\\n**Pain points:**\\n\\n- Fragmentation and entropy are real threats to productivity. From security requirements to cluster management to a thousand data endpoints, there\u2019s too much to keep track of, leading to cognitive overload.\\n- A death by a thousand cuts: constantly logging into new interfaces \u2014 from your cloud provider\u2019s console to some brand new security tool then back to your CI/CD \u2014 is bogging your engineers down with too much context-switching and a lot of noise.\\n- Every day, it\u2019s getting more and more difficult for one team to manage their own microservices, data, and documentation, let alone share their knowledge with other teams.\\n\\n**Recommendation \u2014 Manage, then explore, then create:**\\n\\n- Backstage will allow your teams to get a handle on the software they own, since everything they need to manage it is in one place.\\n- From CI/CD status to documentation to deciphering a monorepo, Backstage makes it easy to manage a service (or other software component) on a day-to-day basis.\\n- The service catalog also helps your developers visualize your existing software ecosystem, beyond the software they own. And with Backstage Software Templates, every new software component is already added to the catalog.\\n- Even at this scale, a small platform team should be all it takes to build and maintain your own version of Backstage. At Spotify, we have a 4-person team responsible for our internal version of Backstage, which is used by all of Spotify\u2019s 1,600+ developers.\\n\\n![More than 1,000 engineers](1000-plus-engineers.png)\\n\\n### My org has 1,000+ engineers\\n\\nIntegrating infrastructure of this size and complexity can seem overwhelming. It\u2019s an even bigger challenge to bring this level of change to a well-established culture with ingrained processes.\\n\\n**Pain points:**\\n\\n- When you\u2019re this large, you\u2019ve incorporated a lot of technology and processes, as well as a lot of partners, each with their own technologies and processes.\\n- You\u2019re focussed on \u201creplacing cruft\u201d and bringing discoverability and order to your vast ecosystem of components and tools.\\n- Getting your tools adopted by your engineers while modernizing your tech stack and coordinating with your infra teams to improve your engineering practices across the whole company\u2026 it\u2019s a lot.\\n\\n**Recommendation \u2014 Create, then manage, then explore:**\\n\\n- The fastest way to bring change to your ecosystem is to start at the beginning of the chain with Backstage Software Templates.\\n- With every new component created with your templates, you\u2019re establishing best practices and rewarding your developers with a streamlined experience focused on their needs \u2014 all the while building up your new service catalog.\\n- The more the templates ease the process of starting up a project, the more your engineers will adopt them, and the faster the other benefits of Backstage will build up, transforming productivity across your organization.

They needed to find a tool that would simplify and streamline creating new apps on AWS and allow their developers to build quickly and easily while adhering to best practices and security requirements. And that\u2019s where Backstage came in\u2026. \\n\\nAWS supported TMNA to solve this problem through a developer portal built off the Backstage core framework. The result was a shiny, new internal development platform called \u201cChofer\u201d \u2014 Spanish for \u201cchauffeur\u201d as an homage to Toyota\u2019s manufacturing presence in Mexico. \\n\\nToday, Chofer supports 100+ application teams, 1,600+ cloud applications, and 40+ AWS services \u2013 helping the company save money by deploying secure, modern applications at scale more quickly than ever before.\\n\\n\\n### Streamlining to a single interface \\n\\nTMNA spent six months in late 2020 assembling the team to build their Backstage instance and working with AWS to map out their project needs. They started building out the Chofer frontend in February 2021 and, in a few short months, the team released an MVP Chofer for TMNA developers to start using. \\n\\nOver time, Chofer has grown to unify infrastructure tooling, services, training, observability, cost tracking, infrastructure scaffolding, and documentation into a single streamlined development interface. Chofer\u2019s goal is to take the guesswork out of the equation for developers allowing them to create new apps and templates quickly and at scale in partnership with its security teams. \\n\\nAs Kishore Jonnalagedda, Director of Engineering at TMNA, says: \u201cSecurity patterns and scalability are already taken into account. All these things \u2013 capacity, operations, cost optimization, cost transparency, and security \u2013 are being built into the application without the application team having to think of them in detail.\u201d\\n\\n\\n### Going places...a lot faster\\n\\nBecause Backstage is cloud-agnostic, TMNA was able to customize Backstage according to their AWS needs and make their AWS deployments go even faster. Specifically, TMNA used Backstage\u2019s [Software Templates](https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-templates/) and [Software Catalog](https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-catalog/) to program 40+ templates so that developers can easily deploy containerized applications using [Amazon ECS](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/) or [Amazon EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/), for example. Additionally, they\u2019ve configured their Backstage app to implement specific backend parameters across different AWS regions and create dashboards that track cost expenditure.\\n\\nThe combined power of the self-service catalog and software templates allows TMNA developers to move faster. Now, developers can ship projects in a matter of weeks, not quarters. In fact, one team reported that they saved six weeks of effort \u2014 equivalent to $250,000 \u2014 with these improvements by not having to build a particular application from scratch.\\n\\nThe TMNA cloud team can also ensure deployments are backward compatible and upgraded along with CI/CD pipelines, saving its application teams an additional estimated 4-6 weeks on these tasks.\\n\\n\\n### A big win for the bottom line\\n\\nAs a result of its increased developer productivity, TMNA saw an overall cost reduction of more than $10 million in 2022 \u2013 as well as a reduction of around $5 million in annual cloud infrastructure costs, saving up to $96,000 in infrastructure costs per team. \\n\\nTMNA was also able to track its go-green initiatives using Chofer\u2019s Cloud Carbon Footprint tool, which reveals the various TMNA teams\u2019 carbon footprints, their cloud spend, and their cost optimization recommendations.\\n\\nUltimately, by leveraging the power of AWS and Backstage, TMNA saw a reduction in costs, with a huge impact on developer effectiveness. Now, its application teams are working to further their cloud competencies and showcase their cloud expertise through blogs and training \u2013 helping other teams to adopt Chofer and bring Backstage\u2019s many benefits to other areas of the business.\\n\\nRead the original case study [here](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/toyota-ecs-case-study/).\\nUsing Backstage?

Their distributed development teams work together to create an \u201cend-to-end online self-service experience in the real estate market.\u201d \\n\\nThey adopted Backstage to help their engineers [create, manage, and explore](https://backstage.spotify.com/blog/adopting-backstage/) their tech ecosystem. In a recent post on their [QuintoAndar Tech Blog](https://medium.com/quintoandar-tech-blog/how-we-are-improving-developer-experience-at-quintoandar-with-backstage-io-fa1ab70b75cb), engineer Gabriel Dantas describes how their platform team built their Backstage-powered service catalog to create a \u201csource of truth\u201d for all their services.\\n## Bookmarks and spreadsheets, oh my\\nBefore adopting Backstage, QuintoAndar\u2019s developers were managing their tools with browser bookmarks and using a spreadsheet as a services directory (hey, [we\u2019ve all been there](https://backstage.spotify.com/blog/kubecon-na-2021/) \ud83d\ude2c). \\n\\nThat might work when you\u2019re a small team working in the same room, but over the last two years, QuintoAndar\u2019s business had grown 4x and wasn\u2019t showing any signs of slowing down. As we saw with fintech [Brex](https://backstage.spotify.com/blog/community-session/11-brex-backstage-upgrade-helper/), when your startup is growing quickly, complexity comes at you fast, with your headcount growing along with your infrastructure. \\n\\n   From Gabriel Dantas\' post:\\n\\n  > It is typical for developers to use more than one tool in their daily development, such as ArgoCD, Drone CI, Grafana, Thanos, and Kibana.\\n  \\n  > Inside QuintoAndar the tools are dynamically provisioned and can have their addresses changed. This means that addresses that were saved in the favorites bar or in documentation were deprecated with a certain frequency. Keeping our developers up to date with news is always a challenge and not addressing this issue has a strong impact on engineering productivity.\\n\\nNot only was QuintoAndar managing tools with bookmarks and spreadsheets \u2014 but also the local addresses and owners for their tools changed on a steady cadence. So the information on these tools often became deprecated, outdated, and lacked awareness. The disjointed approach hurt internal productivity for developers. QuintoAndar needed a source of truth for their tools that remained up-to-date and acted as an easily discoverable and usable developer hub for the entire company.  \\n## Out with the old and in with the new \\nQuintoAndar knew that managing tools via bookmarks and spreadsheets was not sustainable alongside their rapid growth. So, they turned to Backstage to help mitigate the spreadsheet chaos. Within Backstage, they found the [Software Catalog](https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-catalog/software-catalog-overview) the most helpful.\\n \\n   Gabriel Dantas:\\n   \\n  > With Backstage we are able to expose in a unified way everything that is needed to create and maintain infrastructure resources, follow CI/CD pipelines, and visualize observability metrics, without the developer needing to have specific knowledge about the tools, being a true hub of information for any developer within the company.\\n\\n> Remember the spreadsheet? It was time to kill it with fire.\\n    \\nThe Software Catalog enabled them to highlight and unify tooling required to create and maintain infrastructure, follow CI/CD pipelines, and visualize observability metrics, without the developer needing to have specific knowledge about the tools. They found the Software Catalog to be a source of truth for every developer in the company. \\n## From chaos to creators  \\nQuintoAndar didn\u2019t stop upgrading their developer experience just with the Software Catalog. They integrated Backstage into their production workloads with custom yaml and even created a number of their own plugins. And the most exciting part? QuintoAndar created three new plugins (Security Overview, Service Assessment, and Toolbox) that they plan to contribute to the Backstage Open Source community soon! THANK YOU QuintoAndar! \\n\\nQuintoAndar went from struggling with managing developer tools with bookmarks and spreadsheets to not only solving their own challenges, but sharing tools to combat challenges that other companies face."},{"id":"/adopter-spotlight/dazn","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/adopter-spotlight/dazn","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/adopter-spotlight/dazn/index.md","source":"@site/blog/adopter-spotlight/dazn/index.md","title":"Adopter Spotlight: DAZN scores with Backstage","description":"Learn how international sports streamer DAZN made the leap from storing manifest files in repos to a fully functional developer portal.","date":"2023-07-13T12:03:52.805Z","formattedDate":"July 13, 2023","tags":[],"readingTime":2.435,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Helen Greul, Spotify"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Adopter Spotlight: DAZN scores with Backstage","description":"Learn how international sports streamer DAZN made the leap from storing manifest files in repos to a fully functional developer portal.","author":"Helen Greul, Spotify","publishedISODate":"2021-10-14","previewImage":"./preview.png"},"prevItem":{"title":"Adopter Spotlight: QuintoAndar uses Backstage to create a source of truth","permalink":"/blog/adopter-spotlight/quintoandar"},"nextItem":{"title":"Adopter Spotlight: American Airlines demos Runway","permalink":"/blog/adopter-spotlight/american-airlines-runway"}},"content":"![Backstage spotlight on DAZN](dazn-spotlight.png)\\n\\nInternational sports streamer [DAZN][dazn] has about 500 software engineers distributed around the world. They also have a 12-person developer experience team dedicated to serving them. As they state on the DAZN Engineering blog, the [DX team\u2019s mission][dx] is to:\\n\\n> Empower every developer to build the best products and reach their goals by providing the best tools in a supportive and responsive way.\\n\\nTheir latest tool for fulfilling that mission? Backstage. DAZN recently wrote about how they got their Backstage developer portal up and running. Turns out, they had a good head start.\\n\\n## Step 1: YAML files for everyone\\n\\nDAZN had a unique advantage when they decided to adopt Backstage. To help track ownership and documentation for their microservices and other components, they had already started creating YAML files describing their services in all their repos. The metadata in these custom manifest files was useful \u2014 but the information was scattered in repos across the org.\\n\\n## Step 2: Instant software catalog\\n\\nLuckily, all they had to do was ingest those YAML files into Backstage \u2014 and, voila, they had a working developer portal, complete with a centralized software catalog:\\n\\n![DAZN\u2019s software catalog inside Backstage](dazn-catalog.png \'DAZN imported their custom manifest files into Backstage to create a centralized software catalog.\')\\n\\nThis proved to be a real game changer for DAZN\u2019s 500 developers. As principal engineer Marco Crivellaro writes in the post:\\n\\n> Backstage makes it possible to view and manage thousands of services, through discoverability\u2026 Backstage provides an interface for every team to view all the services that they own, the dependencies of the service, and its documentation.\\n\\n## Step 3: Add plugins!\\n\\nOnce the catalog was up and running, DAZN could take advantage of the [Plugin Marketplace][plugins], adding integrations for [Jira][ji], [TODO][to], [PagerDuty][pa], and whatever other functionality the DAZN team or the community decides to build for Backstage next.\\n\\n![DAZN uses the open source Jira plugin for Backstage](dazn-jira.png \'DAZN\u2019s developer portal integrates with Jira, thanks to an open-source plugin available in the Backstage Plugin Marketplace.\')\\n\\nCrivellaro describes the advantages of building on top of a plugin-based architecture and open source ecosystem, which allows \u201cBackstage adopters to benefit from the growing community, and also extend the platform to suit any individual needs.\u201d\\n\\nRead Crivellaro\u2019s whole post \u2014 \u201c[Integrating Backstage at DAZN][medium]\u201d \u2014 to learn more about DAZN\u2019s road to Backstage and how they\u2019re contributing back to the open source community with [improvements][1] [of][2] [their][3] [own][4].\\n\\n[Read more about how DAZN got started with Backstage][medium] \u2192\\n\\n[Read more about their DX team\u2019s approach to developer experience][dx] \u2192\\n\\n_If you\u2019re wondering the best way for your organization to get up and running with Backstage, [we can help][getting-started].

First, to the publicly listed adopters as your visible support for the project excites others to learn more about Backstage. Second, to those non-listed adopters, many of whom still engage in the community via issues, comments, or code contributions. Thank you!\\n\\n## Why we care about public adopters\\n\\n![The pace of public adoption has accelerated over the last year](./public-backstage-adopters.png)\\n\\nIf you roll the clock back to early 2020 when Backstage was open sourced, we never could\u2019ve imagined surpassing this milestone. It feels particularly big given that Backstage tends to be adopted by complex organizations with hundreds (if not thousands of) developers and thousands (if not tens of thousands) of software components.\\n\\nWe\u2019ve also seen such diverse examples of Backstage in the wild. Adopters as varied as [American Airlines][am] and [Splunk][sp] have demoed their Backstage-built developer portals. We\u2019ve seen digital-first companies like [Zalando][za] and [DAZN][da] share their journey from proof-of-concept to in-production. And the developer experience team at [Expedia Group][ex] has been shared at multiple Community Sessions, detailing their adoption journey as well as contributing back with ideas for new features.\\n\\nFor the Backstage project, public adopters are important because they provide a wide variety of use cases, industries, and degrees of complexity (teams, number of services, etc.) that Backstage is able to support. In addition, a growing adopters list shows the project\u2019s maturity and helps other organizations understand the benefits and make the decision to join the project and the community.\\n\\nIn other words, the more the public adopters list grows and becomes more diverse, the more the community will grow and provide contributions that benefit all adopters.\\n\\n## Fifty is just the beginning\\n\\n![Backstage is growing: 52+ pull requests per week, excluding maintainers. Over 13,000 stars on GitHub. 518 total contributors, with about 7+ new contributors per week.](./backstage-stats.png)\\n\\nWhile we\u2019re thrilled to celebrate this milestone, the public adopters list is just one metric we monitor in the overall health of the Backstage project. It definitely doesn\u2019t tell the whole story! We\u2019re seeing continued growth within the contributor community, PRs, and GitHub overall ratings as well. As fate would have it, we also recently reached 50+ plugins in the [Backstage Plugin Marketplace][plugins]!\\n\\n## Join us!\\n\\nIf you are a Backstage enthusiast, please [join me][news] and the entire Backstage Team in celebrating this milestone. And if you are a Backstage adopter not already listed in the [GitHub page][gh], consider adding your name to better inform the community and participate in the project.\\n\\n[adopters]: https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/ADOPTERS.md\\n[am]: https://backstage.spotify.com/blog/adopter-spotlight/american-airlines-runway/\\n[sp]: https://backstage.spotify.com/blog/community-session/splunk-pink-phonebook/\\n[za]: https://youtu.be/6sg5uMCLxTA\\n[da]: https://medium.com/dazn-tech/developer-experience-dx-at-dazn-e6de9a0208d2\\n[ex]: https://backstage.spotify.com/blog/community-session/firehydrant-expedia-loblaw/\\n[plugins]: https://backstage.io/plugins\\n[news]: https://info.backstage.spotify.com/newsletter_subscribe\\n[gh]: https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/ADOPTERS.md"}]}')}}]);
