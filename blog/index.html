We covered future plans for the Spotify Plugins for Backstage bundle and introduced new areas we’re investing to drive more value for Backstage adopters. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-pVOwbgfI0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Watch the webinar recording here</a>. </p><p>Today, the Spotify team working on Backstage held our first-ever Spotify for Backstage roadmap webinar. We’ll be hosting these events on a regular basis to ensure we’re building in the open to share our learnings, upcoming new features, and a look ahead toward Spotify’s continued investment in Backstage. </p><p>The bottom line? Spotify is committed to delivering more value to Backstage adopters faster. In addition to improvements to the <a href="https://backstage.spotify.com/plugins/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spotify Plugins for Backstage</a> bundle we launched in open beta last December, we plan to address barriers to adoption, build more Spotify opinionation into our new features, and make our products easier to use. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-plugin-bundle-gets-a-glow-up-and-release-notes"><strong>The plugin bundle gets a glow up (and release notes!)</strong><a href="#the-plugin-bundle-gets-a-glow-up-and-release-notes" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to the-plugin-bundle-gets-a-glow-up-and-release-notes" title="Direct link to the-plugin-bundle-gets-a-glow-up-and-release-notes">​</a></h3><p>First, a little history: The <a href="https://backstage.spotify.com/plugins/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spotify Plugins for Backstage</a> is a paid subscription available to all Backstage adopters. The bundle subscription includes five plugins designed to address different aspects of developer experience and engineering culture. </p><p>Some of these plugins (<a href="https://backstage.spotify.com/plugins/soundcheck/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Soundcheck</a>, <a href="https://backstage.spotify.com/plugins/skill-exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Skill Exchange</a>, and <a href="https://backstage.spotify.com/plugins/pulse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pulse</a>) are external versions of some of the most popular homegrown plugins we’ve relied on for years at Spotify — with thousands of Spotifiers using them daily. </p><p>Others are new plugins (<a href="https://backstage.spotify.com/plugins/rbac/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Role-Based Access Control</a> and <a href="https://backstage.spotify.com/plugins/insights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Insights</a>) we created specifically to address enterprise needs and make Backstage more powerful and easier to adopt. </p><p>Since we launched the bundle, we’ve been floored by the level of interest in the plugins. We’ve spoken with hundreds of companies across various stages of Backstage adoption and have spent these last five months quickly shipping enhancements and highly requested new features. </p><p>We also launched a new <a href="https://backstage.spotify.com/release-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Release Notes page</a> on our website earlier today, so that you can stay up-to-date with the latest releases for the plugin bundle. </p><p>Now, let’s get to the highlight reel!</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="a-deep-dive-on-soundcheck">A deep dive on Soundcheck<a href="#a-deep-dive-on-soundcheck" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to A deep dive on Soundcheck" title="Direct link to A deep dive on Soundcheck">​</a></h4><p>We don’t play favorites, but we’ve seen a huge amount of interest in Soundcheck and, frankly, we’re not surprised. Soundcheck fundamentally changed our tech health ecosystem at Spotify. We went from using spreadsheets to monitor the quality and reliability of 30,000+ components 😵‍💫 to incentivizing code alignment to our engineering best practices in real time 💪. </p><p>Since the beta launch, we’ve met with a lot of folks looking to leverage features like scorecards and health checks to create actionable feedback loops. In particular, we’ve heard your requests for third-party tool integrations, the ability for adopters to extend and make API calls to other tools, and your feedback that there is a high barrier to entry for organizations that may not have these types of frameworks already in place.</p><p>We are proud to say that we’ve listened to that feedback and, as of our March release, Soundcheck now comes with the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@spotify/backstage-plugin-soundcheck-backend#fact-framework" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fact framework</a> and an initial set of <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@spotify/backstage-plugin-soundcheck-backend#third-party-integrations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">third-party integrations</a>. </p><p>With fact framework, customers no longer have to manually push check results to Soundcheck to make a check go from red to green. Instead, Soundcheck evaluates facts against rules you specify and submit results on your behalf. </p><p>For third-party integrations, customers can now integrate Soundcheck with source control management (SCM), Github, Bitbucket, Gerrit, and Gitlab. </p><p>In the future, the Soundcheck team Spotify will be working on delivering:</p><ul><li>No-code UI: Write checks and programs without code. </li><li>Aggregations and Reporting: View, export, and understand how teams and components are doing compared to established best practices. </li><li>Visualizations and Alerts:  Monitor trends, graphs and historical views, and receive notifications when levels change.</li><li>Lastly, waaaaay more third-party integrations: Expect to see more third-party integrations like Snyk, Sonarqube, and Argo CD, and more!</li></ul><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="and-more-to-come-for-the-rest">And more to come for the rest<a href="#and-more-to-come-for-the-rest" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to And more to come for the rest" title="Direct link to And more to come for the rest">​</a></h4><p>Like we said, we love our plugins equally ❤️, and our plugin delivery teams have been busy making updates and planning new releases for RBAC, Skill Exchange, Pulse, and Insights. </p><p>We’ve made notable improvements to RBAC and Skill Exchange based on initial customer feedback. <strong>RBAC</strong> has received a whole slew of new features since launch, including import/export, policy diffing, locally saved drafts, default policy configuration, and integration with Backstage software templates. </p><p>For <strong>Skill Exchange,</strong> we’ve migrated the plugin off the Docker backend service, which improves the installation and maintenance experience for adopters. We also added Slack integration, allowing users and owners to receive alerts of Skill Exchange posts using Slack. </p><p>And there’s more to come, including:</p><ul><li><strong>RBAC</strong> accessibility and policy testing</li><li>Activity recommendation based on a user’s skill profile and high-priority activity labeling (such as company-wide initiatives) in <strong>Skill Exchange</strong></li><li>Extended question sets, free text responses, and industry benchmarking for <strong>Pulse</strong></li><li>And we’re turning <strong>Insights</strong> into a full-fledged plugin (results currently populate to a dashboard on backstage.spotify.com) with adoption reports and deeper insights!</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="going-beyond-the-bundle">Going beyond the bundle<a href="#going-beyond-the-bundle" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Going beyond the bundle" title="Direct link to Going beyond the bundle">​</a></h3><p>The Spotify team is really excited about where the plugin bundle is going, and we’re equally pumped about the areas we’re investing in to remove barriers to Backstage adoption and make it easier to securely extend Backstage.  </p><p>One area we’re excited to explore is professional services, where we’ll be looking to offer more hands-on support to a small group of customers. </p><p>We also will continue our contributions to evolve the core platform alongside the community. Most notably, we’re investing in improvements to the Software Catalog to make it easier to get up-and-running, and are evaluating opportunities to improve performance of the Catalog. </p><p>Lastly, accessibility is at the heart of what we believe here at Spotify, and we’re committed to continuing to make the Backstage project inclusive to all. By Q3 2023, we’re seeking to bring the plugin bundle and the open source core components into compliance with <a href="https://www.section508.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Section 508</a> requirements of the U.S. government.</p><p>Our work to bring more of Spotiy’s expertise and maturity to the Backstage ecosystem has shown us we can build compelling solutions to problems that all organizations face – like scaling successfully, navigating complexity, and empowering teams. </p><p>With that in mind, we’re introducing two new exciting products that the Backstage community can expect to learn more about in the next few months🚀. </p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="quickstart-for-backstage">Quickstart for Backstage<a href="#quickstart-for-backstage" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Quickstart for Backstage" title="Direct link to Quickstart for Backstage">​</a></h4><p>We recently celebrated Backstage hitting an important milestone with more than 1,000 companies around the world leveraging the project. But we also hear feedback that Backstage can be tough to get started with. </p><p>Our answer: <strong>Spotify Quickstart for Backstage ⏩</strong>. We’re building  a Quickstart product that will enable adopters to get up and running much faster by removing the need to stand up and maintain a codebase in order to adopt Backstage.</p><p>Adopters that use Quickstart will benefit from dramatically reduced cost of maintenance, by reducing the need to make code changes or redeploy. Quickstart will sit alongside the open source platform and will offer Backstage admins an opinionated starting point. </p><p>Our aim is that Quickstart makes it easier than ever for adopters to get started with Backstage, so that you can focus on extending your Backstage instance where you have unique needs.  </p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="marketplace-for-backstage">Marketplace for Backstage<a href="#marketplace-for-backstage" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Marketplace for Backstage" title="Direct link to Marketplace for Backstage">​</a></h4><p>In addition to Quickstart, we’ve been looking to better understand how adopters find and validate plugins to add to their Backstage instance. </p><p>What we’ve learned is that — while the open source plugin ecosystem is very rich and continues to grow —  there’s no easy way of understanding which of the 100+ open source plugins are actively maintained, secure, and validated. It’s also difficult to find the right options when your needs evolve and may not be supported by open source offerings alone. </p><p>Our goal is to make it easy to find what you need throughout your experience using Backstage, and we want to make it easier than ever to add new capabilities. So we’re investing in a <strong>Spotify Marketplace for Backstage</strong> that will provide a trusted set of resources to help as your organization’s needs evolve 🤝. </p><p>The Marketplace will contain solutions from Spotify and trusted third-party partners. All of the capabilities available within our Marketplace will work seamlessly with Quickstart, and will enable users to easily enable add-ons with a few clicks. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="book-a-demo-to-learn-more">Book a demo to learn more<a href="#book-a-demo-to-learn-more" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Book a demo to learn more" title="Direct link to Book a demo to learn more">​</a></h2><p>We are really excited to share more about these two key features from Spotify.

We’ve been busy since launching the Spotify Plugins for Backstage bundle subscription in December, and we’re excited to share what we’re building next for Backstage and the bundle. <a href="https://info.backstage.spotify.com/roadmap" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sign up for our commercial roadmap webinar on May 9.</a></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="since-we-last-spoke">Since we last spoke<a href="#since-we-last-spoke" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Since we last spoke" title="Direct link to Since we last spoke">​</a></h2><p>It’s been a busy few months since we launched <a href="https://backstage.spotify.com/plugins/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spotify Plugins for Backstage</a> into public beta back in December. Since then, we’ve been busy welcoming new customers and improving the bundle based on the feedback we’re hearing from you. We’ve learned a lot and are in active development on more than a few exciting products. We can’t wait to share them with you soon!</p><p>We’re excited to highlight some recent updates for our <a href="https://backstage.spotify.com/plugins/soundcheck/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Soundcheck</a> plugin in particular. Since launch, we’ve released two new features aimed at making it easier to get up and running with the plugin while also improving your ability to take action on the valuable insights the plugin provides. Most notably, we recently released a <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@spotify/backstage-plugin-soundcheck-backend#fact-framework" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fact Framework</a> and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@spotify/backstage-plugin-soundcheck-backend#third-party-integrations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">third-party integrations</a>. The Fact Framework allows Soundcheck to collect facts (un-opinionated information) about an entity in the software catalog. Facts are made available to Soundcheck through fact collectors. For example, the GitHub fact collector extracts one or more facts about GitHub projects/repositories. Soundcheck can also be extended by registering additional fact collectors. This enables adopters to extend Soundcheck in ways relevant to their organization, systems and infrastructure.</p><p>Together, these two features provide a clearer onramp to navigate checks using best practices (tested and proven at Spotify). Additionally, these new releases will make it easier to expand your programs over time through a growing library of out-of-the-box integrations with first and third-party tools, like the Backstage Software Catalog, GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, and Gerrit.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-weve-learned">What we’ve learned<a href="#what-weve-learned" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What we’ve learned" title="Direct link to What we’ve learned">​</a></h2><p>In addition to the improvements we’re making to the plugins themselves, we’re also excited to share some customer insights from the past few months.</p><ul><li><strong>The Spotify plugins help companies adopt Backstage successfully:</strong> We’ve really enjoyed speaking with current and prospective Backstage adopters around the world on how these plugins can help advance their developer experience goals. We’re seeing incredible interest for the plugin bundle across all industries, organization sizes, and levels of maturity with Backstage.

With a well adopted and tested search platform we feel confident to release Backstage Search as 1.0. </p><p>Packages included in Backstage Search 1.0 release are:</p><p><strong>Core search packages</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@backstage/plugin-search" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@backstage/plugin-search</a>   </li><li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@backstage/plugin-search-react" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@backstage/plugin-search-react  </a>  </li><li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@backstage/plugin-search-common" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@backstage/plugin-search-common</a></li><li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@backstage/plugin-search-backend" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@backstage/plugin-search-backend</a>     </li><li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@backstage/plugin-search-backend-node" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@backstage/plugin-search-backend-node</a></li></ul><p><strong>Modules</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@backstage/plugin-search-backend-module-elasticsearch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@backstage/plugin-search-backend-module-elasticsearch</a></li></ul><p>No additional features are released as part of the major release as the maintainers of the search packages focused on the following for this release: </p><ul><li>Bug fixes and clean up of deprecations.</li><li>Improved error handling for missing indices. </li><li>Separation of AWS Elastic and Open Elastic support.</li><li>Refactor the packages by moving reusable components from <code>@backstage/plugin-search</code> to <code>@backstage/plugin-search-react</code>.</li><li>Improved documentation including tutorials for how to <a href="https://backstage.io/docs/plugins/integrating-search-into-plugins" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Integrate Search into a plugin</a>.</li></ul><p>You might have noticed that the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@backstage/plugin-search-backend-module-pg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@backstage/plugin-search-backend-module-pg</a> package is not part of 1.0.

While this is a good engine to use on a smaller scale and for local development (to avoid having to set up a search engine instance separately), it also has its limitations such as: </p><ul><li>Lunr does not scale well. Horizontally scaled deployments of Backstage and/or Backstage Search backend using Lunr result in either duplicated indexing processes and indices or inconsistent index state across nodes.</li><li>Lunr’s filter functionality is limited, especially for <a href="https://github.com/olivernn/lunr.js/issues/353" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">logical AND/OR operators</a>.</li><li>Lunr has a smaller community than Elasticsearch, which could mean that adopters relying on it will have less by way of resources for iterating on and improving search. </li></ul><p>Therefore, we recommend using Elasticsearch for production usage.  Moving forward, the search maintainers will prioritize the Elasticsearch engine and the community will maintain the Postgres engine. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-to-contribute">How to contribute<a href="#how-to-contribute" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How to contribute" title="Direct link to How to contribute">​</a></h3><p>If you want to contribute and to further improve search, you can check out the <a href="https://github.com/backstage/backstage/issues?q=is%3Aissue+search+label%3Asearch+is%3Aopen" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open issues labeled with search</a> or reach out to us at the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/687207715902193673/770283289327566848" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#search</a> Discord channel.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-to-get-started">How to get started<a href="#how-to-get-started" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How to get started" title="Direct link to How to get started">​</a></h3><p>If you haven’t adopted the Backstage Search Platform yet and feel like now is a good time.

We continue to focus on improving the stability and scalability of Backstage while enhancing its functionality. Thanks to focused efforts from the TechDocs core team and community, we&#x27;re happy to say that TechDocs — <a href="https://backstage.io/blog/2020/09/08/announcing-tech-docs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our docs-like-code solution</a> for all the software in your catalog — is now, after <a href="https://backstage.io/blog/2021/07/26/software-templates-are-now-in-beta" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Software Templates</a>, the second core feature to graduate to beta.</p><p>In addition to new features and improvements, we made numerous compatibility updates ahead of this feature release. You&#x27;ll find support for a variety of CI systems, cloud storage solutions, and source control systems — so that TechDocs works for most orgs, right out of box. But there&#x27;s much more to explore in this beta, thanks to contributions from the community.</p><p>When we set out to define what beta looked like, we combed through GitHub issues, Discord discussions, and other media to identify common pain points and challenges encountered by those around the world who consume and author TechDocs documentation in their organization&#x27;s Backstage instance. Based on this research, we put together a user-focused milestone and got to work. For an issue-by-issue breakdown, check out the milestone <a href="https://github.com/backstage/backstage/milestone/29?closed=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on GitHub</a> — or, just read on to get the highlights.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="real-time-builds-and-feedback">Real-time builds and feedback<a href="#real-time-builds-and-feedback" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Real-time builds and feedback" title="Direct link to Real-time builds and feedback">​</a></h2><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Click the refresh button to hot-reload the updated content" src="/assets/images/refresh-button-2e127d36597f8d885f4ccfd4e94dc0ba.gif" width="1855" height="992" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>TechDocs can be transformational once fully up and running (update your code and your docs with the same pull request!). But for first-time users and especially those unfamiliar with the MkDocs ecosystem upon which TechDocs is built, there are often many small, obtuse hurdles that can get in the way of success. Leading up to the beta release, we worked to surface and improve relevant errors and other details during the documentation generation process. Better still, all of this detail is now provided to users <em>in real-time</em>, as docs are generated and refreshed.</p><p>🙌 Shout out to Dominik Henneke for implementing the interactive experience.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="custom-homepages-make-techdocs-yours">Custom homepages: Make TechDocs yours<a href="#custom-homepages-make-techdocs-yours" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Custom homepages: Make TechDocs yours" title="Direct link to Custom homepages: Make TechDocs yours">​</a></h2><p><img loading="lazy" alt="TechDocs custom homepage" src="/assets/images/techdocs-custom-homepage-52e0ff803c9b71f66cf8b192ae11e453.png" width="1822" height="725" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>We strive to make it so that you can mold Backstage into the shape that best fits your organization.

The form of this magic — the <code>backstage.io/techdocs-ref</code> annotation — has evolved over TechDocs&#x27; life. But unless you&#x27;re a real Backstage aficionado, the specifics of what the value meant and how to construct it could be somewhat of a mystery.</p><p>In the beta, we&#x27;ve simplified this annotation dramatically for documentation authors, aligning its value with TechDocs&#x27; docs-like-code philosophy itself. In the vast majority of cases, its value will simply be <code>dir:.</code> — which means this catalog entity contains documentation and the mkdocs.yml file describing this documentation lives in the current directory. We continue to support edge cases for <a href="https://backstage.io/docs/features/techdocs/how-to-guides#how-to-understand-techdocs-ref-annotation-values" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">other techdocs-ref annotation values</a>, as well.</p><p>👏 Another round of applause for Dominik for driving this improvement through.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="everything-neat-and-tidy">Everything neat and tidy<a href="#everything-neat-and-tidy" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Everything neat and tidy" title="Direct link to Everything neat and tidy">​</a></h2><p>If you&#x27;ve ever twitched a little looking at the address bar as you navigated through your TechDocs, because the &quot;C&quot; in &quot;Component&quot; was capitalized, or cringed whilst perusing through your TechDocs storage bucket, only to see assets you definitely remember deleting from a documentation site cluttering up the place…twitch and cringe no more!</p><p>TechDocs base paths are now case-insensitive, stale files are automatically cleaned up by the TechDocs publishing process — and even though <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/6NDaYWg85ZnJ3Ae0WkILWh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I say <em>.yaml</em> and you say <em>.yml</em></a> — TechDocs will now happily accept either file extension for your MkDocs YAML file.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-should-i-do-to-upgrade">What should I do to upgrade?<a href="#what-should-i-do-to-upgrade" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What should I do to upgrade?" title="Direct link to What should I do to upgrade?">​</a></h2><p>If you&#x27;ve been waiting for the beta to give TechDocs a shot, good news!

Throughout the year, we’ve been focussed on improving the stability and scalability of these areas while enhancing the feature sets based upon requests from the community. Software Templates — which enable push-button deployments with all your standards and best practices built-in — is our first feature-complete release candidate to graduate to beta. Read on to learn how this release improves template customization and flexibility, as well as performance.</p><p>Let’s rewind a little bit, around a year in fact. Backstage had been open sourced, and we released our first version of Software Templates and our Scaffolder plugin.</p><p>In case you missed it, <a href="https://backstage.io/blog/2020/08/05/announcing-backstage-software-templates" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Software Templates</a> are part of the Create feature set, where you can set up Backstage to give your engineers the ability to spin up a new microservice, website, or any other software component with your organization’s best practices built-in, right from the start.</p><p>Back when we released the first version of these templates, with the <code>apiVersion</code> <code>backstage.io/v1alpha1</code>, they were a little restrictive in what they could do. The generated repository could only have one template source and it was restricted to only being <a href="https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cookiecutter</a> templates. And it had to fit into the three stages of templating which was <code>Prepare</code>, <code>Template</code>, and <code>Publish</code>.</p><p>We <a href="https://github.com/backstage/backstage/issues/2771" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">opened up for feedback</a> from the community knowing that this wasn’t going to be the final version, but something of a stepping stone to where we want to be in the future.</p><p>And now we come to today…</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="anddddd-actions-">Anddddd… Action(s)! 🎬<a href="#anddddd-actions-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Anddddd… Action(s)! 🎬" title="Direct link to Anddddd… Action(s)! 🎬">​</a></h2><p>Following the removal of the previously deprecated <code>backstage.io/v1alpha1</code> templates, today we’re officially announcing the beta version of Software Templates, or <code>backstage.io/v1beta2</code>.</p><p>With it comes an entirely new architecture to the Software Templates functionality, and a load of new exciting features, which I’ll dig into a little deeper.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="template-actions">Template actions<a href="#template-actions" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Template actions" title="Direct link to Template actions">​</a></h3><p>We’ve totally opened up the ability to compose your own workflows for each Template that you have registered in Software Templates. This means no restrictions on where your template skeleton is kept, and no restrictions on what your workflow should look like.</p><p>Template Actions are customizable JavaScript functions that allow you to extend the capabilities of the Software Templates by adding your own business logic or reusing some of our Built-In actions.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="New template syntax with actions" src="/assets/images/example-template-code-36716b699eaed4fad8a8206e38ccdee9.png" title="An example of the new template syntax with steps and parameters" width="640" height="1228" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The workflow for Software Templates are now step-based, and each Software Template can have a customizable amount of steps which will in turn call these new actions.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="New steps being rendered in the frontend" src="/assets/images/steps-running-b4ac03c38b16e1d6af751d029a525f50.gif" title="An example of a Template with customizable steps" width="800" height="449" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>These actions are very heavily inspired by GitHub Actions and GitHub Workflows, and we’ve given back a lot of control to the template authors so they can build the boilerplate and push the code however they want.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="custom-ui-extensions">Custom UI extensions<a href="#custom-ui-extensions" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Custom UI extensions" title="Direct link to Custom UI extensions">​</a></h3><p>A large part of the Software Templates feature is the form that we use to collect user input which is then passed on to these new actions. Sometimes, it makes sense that Template Authors want to provide their own React components which can be rendered in the frontend to maybe do some more complex things like calling internal APIs to provide autocomplete.</p><p>This is now possible with the new <code>ScaffolderFieldExtensions</code>.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Custom UI extensions" src="/assets/images/custom-components-521c107f29bb24a8940e0ea5251019a9.gif" title="An example of `ScaffolderFieldExtension` is the `OwnerPicker` component which can automatically add options and suggest typeahead with data from an async API request" width="600" height="264" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Template Authors can create their own components to provide data to the custom actions in any way you see fit, and even override our own built in ones too like the <code>RepoUrlPicker</code>.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="horizontal-scalability">Horizontal scalability<a href="#horizontal-scalability" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Horizontal scalability" title="Direct link to Horizontal scalability">​</a></h3><p>The Scaffolder Service and Software Templates are now horizontally scalable, coordinating work between your deployed backend machines.

A total rethinking of the core search feature in Backstage, it’s more than just a box you type into — it’s a mini platform all by itself. With its composable frontend and extensible backend, you can design and build the search tool that suits your organization’s needs.</p><p>So, you don’t just get an improved out-of-the-box experience for searching whatever is in your software catalog. You can also add support for searching other sources, too. Customize it the way you want and you can search your catalog, your plugins and docs — and even external sources, like Stack Overflow and Confluence — all at once, all right inside Backstage.</p><p>With one query, your teams can find exactly what they’re looking for: anything and everything.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="search-and-explore">Search and explore<a href="#search-and-explore" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Search and explore" title="Direct link to Search and explore">​</a></h2><p>Being able to easily explore your ecosystem — to discover software, tools, documentation, and other valuable knowledge — is one of <a href="https://backstage.io/blog/2021/05/20/adopting-backstage#three-jobs-create-manage-explore" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the three main jobs of Backstage</a>. Teams should be able to find what other teams have already built, so they can reuse and contribute to components instead of unknowingly duplicating them. Data endpoints should be shared, not siloed away. Services and their APIs should be easily discoverable. Best practices and technical documentation should be easily found.</p><p>Along with the <a href="https://backstage.io/blog/2020/06/22/backstage-service-catalog-alpha" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Backstage Service Catalog</a>, Backstage Search is essential to enabling this discoverability — allowing new hires and old hands alike to explore your infrastructure instead of getting lost inside it.</p><p>We also quickly realized that search looks different from organization to organization. Therefore, we built a search platform that lets you plug in your own search engine, index any information you like, or build a customized search page experience that fits your users’ needs.</p><p>Since finding what you are looking for in Backstage is critical for success, we started by identifying the needs and goals of search.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="rethinking-search-inside-and-out">Rethinking search, inside and out<a href="#rethinking-search-inside-and-out" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Rethinking search, inside and out" title="Direct link to Rethinking search, inside and out">​</a></h2><p>Spotify’s internal version of Backstage has had some of the features of Backstage Search for a while, and open sourcing them has been top of mind since day one. But we didn’t want to just port our internal version to the open source version. We wanted to take the opportunity to apply what we’ve learned inside Spotify over the last year, address the needs we’ve observed in the community, and ultimately open source not just a search feature but a search platform. We started the process by looking at the <a href="https://hbr.org/2016/09/know-your-customers-jobs-to-be-done" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">jobs to be done</a>.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Backstage Search platform" src="/assets/images/jobs-to-be-done-017935cc673ca82e9d43760ab2acbcbf.png" title="A high-level overview of the process, identifying all the jobs of search." width="8122" height="2975" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>First, we looked at which jobs to be done belonged to the search plugin itself (e.g., “collect documents to index”) and which belonged to the other plugins (e.g., “format documents for indexing”), and then whether those jobs belonged to the frontend (“display results”) or the backend (“schedule indexing”).</p><p>Looking at all these various jobs, we defined four goals for the platform:</p><ul><li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Be search engine–agnostic</li><li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> Make it easy for content owners to make their content searchable/discoverable</li><li><strong>Control:</strong> Allow plugin developers to customize their search results components</li><li><strong>Reusability:</strong> Offer reusable components/APIs that other devs can leverage</li></ul><p>Beginning our journey this way — by identifying the jobs to be done first, then defining the product goals from there — we could make sure that the search platform addressed real needs and improved the search experience for both users and plugin developers.</p><p>This approach not only created a better search tool for the open source community, but for Spotify, as well. So, instead of just open sourcing our internal version of search, we ended up with an even better solution — one that we can all use and build on together, both inside and outside Spotify.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="say-hello-to-the-backstage-search-platform">Say hello to the Backstage Search platform<a href="#say-hello-to-the-backstage-search-platform" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Say hello to the Backstage Search platform" title="Direct link to Say hello to the Backstage Search platform">​</a></h2><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Backstage Search platform" src="/assets/images/search-results-7958b00b1c30bfeb3de84cb5707cf5da.png" width="1230" height="681" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>We are now happy and proud to announce our alpha version of the <a href="https://backstage.io/docs/features/search/architecture" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Backstage Search Platform</a>, featuring:</p><ul><li>Bring your own search engine (Flexibility)</li><li>Collators for easily indexing content from plugins and other sources (Simplicity)</li><li>Composable search page experiences (Control, Reusability)</li><li>Customize the look and feel of each search result (Control, Reusability)</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="bring-your-own-search-engine">Bring your own search engine<a href="#bring-your-own-search-engine" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Bring your own search engine" title="Direct link to Bring your own search engine">​</a></h3><p>By introducing a Search Integration Layer, we have been able to keep the query translation of the search term and filters close to the search engine itself. This makes our search backend less focused on how a set of terms and filters should be translated to fit a certain search engine interface and more focused on querying and retrieving results as well as collecting results to index.</p><p>With the Search Integration Layer, your organization can bring your search engine of choice to Backstage — instead of relying on Backstage to support a specific search engine that might not fit the needs of your organization, either today or in the future.</p><p>But that doesn’t mean “batteries not included”. The current version of Backstage Search ships with Lunr support built-in — and support for ElasticSearch is not very far off. And we hope the number of supported search engines will continue to grow with the community’s help.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="collators-for-easily-indexing-content-from-plugins-and-other-sources">Collators for easily indexing content from plugins and other sources<a href="#collators-for-easily-indexing-content-from-plugins-and-other-sources" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Collators for easily indexing content from plugins and other sources" title="Direct link to Collators for easily indexing content from plugins and other sources">​</a></h3><p>Since Backstage’s functionality comes from its plugins, we wanted the process of making plugin content searchable to be as frictionless as possible. Therefore we decided on a concept we call collators. Collators are responsible for collecting documents to index from a plugin. Your collators live inside your own plugin, but are registered in the Backstage app’s search backend.</p><p>Collators can also be used to index external sources, like Stack Overflow and Confluence. You can watch a demo of how easy it is to extend search with collators <a href="https://youtu.be/Z78FFaObTfk?t=339" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="composable-search-page-experiences">Composable search page experiences<a href="#composable-search-page-experiences" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Composable search page experiences" title="Direct link to Composable search page experiences">​</a></h3><p>Every engineering org has different needs — that is something we have definitely learned over the last year. Your software catalog might be set up differently than ours and therefore your needs for how search results look and how the search filters work will also differ.</p><p>That&#x27;s why we have put effort into making your search page experience composable to your organization&#x27;s needs. What do we mean by that? When you adopt Backstage and set up your app, you can set up — or, compose — your search page by using existing components or by creating your own custom ones.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="customize-the-look-and-feel-of-each-search-result">Customize the look and feel of each search result<a href="#customize-the-look-and-feel-of-each-search-result" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Customize the look and feel of each search result" title="Direct link to Customize the look and feel of each search result">​</a></h3><p>A good example of the level of customization the platform allows is how list items are displayed in search results. A search result component can be a list, this list can consist of different list items (search results returned from the search engine) — but these list items could look different depending on what the search result returns in terms of its fields.</p><p>Let’s say that for an entity returned from the software catalog maybe the most important information to show is the name, while a result returned from the TechDocs plugin should maybe show the text content as the most important information. This can be customized by creating </p><div></div> components (like TechDocsResultListItem or CatalogResultListItem or whatever list item component you want) and configuring them in the app.<p></p><p>If there is no need to customize your search result list items, the </p><div></div> component is there for you to reuse.<p></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="getting-started-with-backstage-search">Getting started with Backstage Search<a href="#getting-started-with-backstage-search" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Getting started with Backstage Search" title="Direct link to Getting started with Backstage Search">​</a></h2><p>We put together <a href="https://backstage.io/docs/features/search/getting-started" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a getting started guide</a> that provides two different ways to set up Backstage Search:</p><ul><li>Create a new app and get the most out of the search setup right out of the box, or</li><li>Add the new Backstage Search setup to your existing Backstage app.</li></ul><p>Whichever situation you’re in, we have you covered.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="whats-next">What’s next?<a href="#whats-next" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What’s next?" title="Direct link to What’s next?">​</a></h2><p>We’ve built the foundation for the Backstage Search platform, and we can&#x27;t wait to see the exciting engines, collators, and components the community builds on the platform.</p><p>You can check out our <a href="https://backstage.io/docs/features/search/search-overview#project-roadmap" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">project roadmap</a> in our search documentation or track the progress of our <a href="https://github.com/backstage/backstage/milestone/27" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Beta milestone</a> and <a href="https://github.com/backstage/backstage/milestone/28" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GA milestone</a>.</p><p>For any questions, feedback or ideas about the Backstage Search platform, join us in the #search channel on <a href="https://discord.gg/backstage-687207715902193673" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord</a>!</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/paid-plugins-announcement">Coming next year from Spotify: paid plugins for Backstage</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2023-07-13T12:03:53.422Z" itemprop="datePublished">July 13, 2023</time> · <!-- -->4 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><span itemprop="name">Austin Lamon, Spotify</span></div></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p><img loading="lazy" alt="New Spotify plugins coming next year" src="/assets/images/spotify-paid-plugins-4e32439bcd445bf786478168b1254de9.png" width="1200" height="630" class="img_ev3q"></p><p><strong>TLDR:</strong> Next year, Spotify is going to start selling some new plugins we build for Backstage. We’re doubling down on Backstage with a sustainable business model as the cornerstone to our long-term commitment to the project.

We want to make Backstage the standard developer portal platform across the industry to help developers everywhere be happier and more effective.</p><p>All along, we’ve believed the best way to achieve that goal is by fostering a thriving ecosystem around the platform. Today we’re excited to share the next step in expanding that ecosystem: starting next year, Spotify will begin offering paid plugins for Backstage. This will allow us to bring even more of our expertise and experience to the platform.</p><p>We love Backstage. We depend on Backstage. Right now, only a small portion of the value that Backstage provides within Spotify is available to people outside of Spotify. And as the project has evolved, we’ve heard from adopters and contributors alike that Spotify’s experience and maturity with Backstage is one of the platform’s key differentiators.</p><p>Adding paid plugins from Spotify to the other commercial services surrounding Backstage will make the platform more valuable to current adopters (Spotify included), broaden its reach to new adopters, and create a more diverse ecosystem for the community at large.</p><p>And revenue generated from paid plugins can be reinvested into developing more plugins and evolving Backstage.

We want to keep the momentum on the open source project, while also adding rocket fuel by unlocking more plugin possibilities.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="more-paid-plugins-more-free-plugins--more-value-for-everyone">More paid plugins, more free plugins — more value for everyone<a href="#more-paid-plugins-more-free-plugins--more-value-for-everyone" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to More paid plugins, more free plugins — more value for everyone" title="Direct link to More paid plugins, more free plugins — more value for everyone">​</a></h2><p>If this business model sounds familiar (hello Freemium!), that’s because it&#x27;s a core part of our company mission: to unlock the human potential and creativity out there in the world. We believe developers need a better experience, just like everyone should enjoy music and audio in the ways they want to listen.</p><p>Our intention is to keep adding new plugins to our commercial offering over time. But to be clear — SPOTIFY IS NOT MOVING AWAY FROM OPEN SOURCE CONTRIBUTIONS OR THE BACKSTAGE COMMUNITY. Sorry for getting shouty, but we really don’t want the community we love to get the wrong idea. In fact, it’s really the opposite.</p><p>We’re doubling down on Backstage, and paid plugins enable Spotify to continue to grow our investment in the open source project and community.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="coming-soon-to-a-repo-near-you--sign-up-now">Coming soon to a repo near you — sign up now<a href="#coming-soon-to-a-repo-near-you--sign-up-now" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Coming soon to a repo near you — sign up now" title="Direct link to Coming soon to a repo near you — sign up now">​</a></h2><p>We’ll be talking through our commercialization plan a bit more at this week’s <a href="https://github.com/backstage/community/issues/34" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Backstage Community Session</a>.
