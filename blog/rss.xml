We covered future plans for the Spotify Plugins for Backstage bundle and introduced new areas we‚Äôre investing to drive more value for Backstage adopters. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-pVOwbgfI0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Watch the webinar recording here</a>. </p><p>Today, the Spotify team working on Backstage held our first-ever Spotify for Backstage roadmap webinar. We‚Äôll be hosting these events on a regular basis to ensure we‚Äôre building in the open to share our learnings, upcoming new features, and a look ahead toward Spotify‚Äôs continued investment in Backstage. </p><p>The bottom line? Spotify is committed to delivering more value to Backstage adopters faster. In addition to improvements to the <a href="https://backstage.spotify.com/plugins/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spotify Plugins for Backstage</a> bundle we launched in open beta last December, we plan to address barriers to adoption, build more Spotify opinionation into our new features, and make our products easier to use. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-plugin-bundle-gets-a-glow-up-and-release-notes"><strong>The plugin bundle gets a glow up (and release notes!)</strong><a href="#the-plugin-bundle-gets-a-glow-up-and-release-notes" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to the-plugin-bundle-gets-a-glow-up-and-release-notes" title="Direct link to the-plugin-bundle-gets-a-glow-up-and-release-notes">‚Äã</a></h3><p>First, a little history: The <a href="https://backstage.spotify.com/plugins/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spotify Plugins for Backstage</a> is a paid subscription available to all Backstage adopters. The bundle subscription includes five plugins designed to address different aspects of developer experience and engineering culture. </p><p>Some of these plugins (<a href="https://backstage.spotify.com/plugins/soundcheck/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Soundcheck</a>, <a href="https://backstage.spotify.com/plugins/skill-exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Skill Exchange</a>, and <a href="https://backstage.spotify.com/plugins/pulse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pulse</a>) are external versions of some of the most popular homegrown plugins we‚Äôve relied on for years at Spotify ‚Äî&nbsp;with thousands of Spotifiers using them daily. </p><p>Others are new plugins (<a href="https://backstage.spotify.com/plugins/rbac/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Role-Based Access Control</a> and <a href="https://backstage.spotify.com/plugins/insights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Insights</a>) we created specifically to address enterprise needs and make Backstage more powerful and easier to adopt. </p><p>Since we launched the bundle, we‚Äôve been floored by the level of interest in the plugins. We‚Äôve spoken with hundreds of companies across various stages of Backstage adoption and have spent these last five months quickly shipping enhancements and highly requested new features. </p><p>We also launched a new <a href="https://backstage.spotify.com/release-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Release Notes page</a> on our website earlier today, so that you can stay up-to-date with the latest releases for the plugin bundle. </p><p>Now, let‚Äôs get to the highlight reel!</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="a-deep-dive-on-soundcheck">A deep dive on Soundcheck<a href="#a-deep-dive-on-soundcheck" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to A deep dive on Soundcheck" title="Direct link to A deep dive on Soundcheck">‚Äã</a></h4><p>We don‚Äôt play favorites, but we‚Äôve seen a huge amount of interest in Soundcheck and, frankly, we‚Äôre not surprised. Soundcheck fundamentally changed our tech health ecosystem at Spotify. We went from using spreadsheets to monitor the quality and reliability of 30,000+ components üòµ‚Äçüí´ to incentivizing code alignment to our engineering best practices in real time üí™. </p><p>Since the beta launch, we‚Äôve met with a lot of folks looking to leverage features like scorecards and health checks to create actionable feedback loops. In particular, we‚Äôve heard your requests for third-party tool integrations, the ability for adopters to extend and make API calls to other tools, and your feedback that there is a high barrier to entry for organizations that may not have these types of frameworks already in place.</p><p>We are proud to say that we‚Äôve listened to that feedback and, as of our March release, Soundcheck now comes with the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@spotify/backstage-plugin-soundcheck-backend#fact-framework" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fact framework</a> and an initial set of <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@spotify/backstage-plugin-soundcheck-backend#third-party-integrations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">third-party integrations</a>. </p><p>With fact framework, customers no longer have to manually push check results to Soundcheck to make a check go from red to green. Instead, Soundcheck evaluates facts against rules you specify and submit results on your behalf. </p><p>For third-party integrations, customers can now integrate Soundcheck with source control management (SCM), Github, Bitbucket, Gerrit, and Gitlab. </p><p>In the future, the Soundcheck team Spotify will be working on delivering:</p><ul><li>No-code UI: Write checks and programs without code. </li><li>Aggregations and Reporting: View, export, and understand how teams and components are doing compared to established best practices. </li><li>Visualizations and Alerts:  Monitor trends, graphs and historical views, and receive notifications when levels change.</li><li>Lastly, waaaaay more third-party integrations: Expect to see more third-party integrations like Snyk, Sonarqube, and Argo CD, and more!</li></ul><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="and-more-to-come-for-the-rest">And more to come for the rest<a href="#and-more-to-come-for-the-rest" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to And more to come for the rest" title="Direct link to And more to come for the rest">‚Äã</a></h4><p>Like we said, we love our plugins equally ‚ù§Ô∏è, and our plugin delivery teams have been busy making updates and planning new releases for RBAC, Skill Exchange, Pulse, and Insights. </p><p>We‚Äôve made notable improvements to RBAC and Skill Exchange based on initial customer feedback. <strong>RBAC</strong> has received a whole slew of new features since launch, including import/export, policy diffing, locally saved drafts, default policy configuration, and integration with Backstage software templates. </p><p>For <strong>Skill Exchange,</strong> we‚Äôve migrated the plugin off the Docker backend service, which improves the installation and maintenance experience for adopters. We also added Slack integration, allowing users and owners to receive alerts of Skill Exchange posts using Slack. </p><p>And there‚Äôs more to come, including:</p><ul><li><strong>RBAC</strong> accessibility and policy testing</li><li>Activity recommendation based on a user‚Äôs skill profile and high-priority activity labeling (such as company-wide initiatives) in <strong>Skill Exchange</strong></li><li>Extended question sets, free text responses, and industry benchmarking for <strong>Pulse</strong></li><li>And we‚Äôre turning <strong>Insights</strong> into a full-fledged plugin (results currently populate to a dashboard on backstage.spotify.com) with adoption reports and deeper insights!</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="going-beyond-the-bundle">Going beyond the bundle<a href="#going-beyond-the-bundle" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Going beyond the bundle" title="Direct link to Going beyond the bundle">‚Äã</a></h3><p>The Spotify team is really excited about where the plugin bundle is going, and we‚Äôre equally pumped about the areas we‚Äôre investing in to remove barriers to Backstage adoption and make it easier to securely extend Backstage.  </p><p>One area we‚Äôre excited to explore is professional services, where we‚Äôll be looking to offer more hands-on support to a small group of customers. </p><p>We also will continue our contributions to evolve the core platform alongside the community. Most notably, we‚Äôre investing in improvements to the Software Catalog to make it easier to get up-and-running, and are evaluating opportunities to improve performance of the Catalog. </p><p>Lastly, accessibility is at the heart of what we believe here at Spotify, and we‚Äôre committed to continuing to make the Backstage project inclusive to all. By Q3 2023, we‚Äôre seeking to bring the plugin bundle and the open source core components into compliance with <a href="https://www.section508.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Section 508</a> requirements of the U.S. government.</p><p>Our work to bring more of Spotiy‚Äôs expertise and maturity to the Backstage ecosystem has shown us we can build compelling solutions to problems that all organizations face ‚Äì like scaling successfully, navigating complexity, and empowering teams. </p><p>With that in mind, we‚Äôre introducing two new exciting products that the Backstage community can expect to learn more about in the next few monthsüöÄ. </p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="quickstart-for-backstage">Quickstart for Backstage<a href="#quickstart-for-backstage" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Quickstart for Backstage" title="Direct link to Quickstart for Backstage">‚Äã</a></h4><p>We recently celebrated Backstage hitting an important milestone with more than 1,000 companies around the world leveraging the project. But we also hear feedback that Backstage can be tough to get started with. </p><p>Our answer: <strong>Spotify Quickstart for Backstage ‚è©</strong>. We‚Äôre building  a Quickstart product that will enable adopters to get up and running much faster by removing the need to stand up and maintain a codebase in order to adopt Backstage.</p><p>Adopters that use Quickstart will benefit from dramatically reduced cost of maintenance, by reducing the need to make code changes or redeploy. Quickstart will sit alongside the open source platform and will offer Backstage admins an opinionated starting point. </p><p>Our aim is that Quickstart makes it easier than ever for adopters to get started with Backstage, so that you can focus on extending your Backstage instance where you have unique needs.  </p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="marketplace-for-backstage">Marketplace for Backstage<a href="#marketplace-for-backstage" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Marketplace for Backstage" title="Direct link to Marketplace for Backstage">‚Äã</a></h4><p>In addition to Quickstart, we‚Äôve been looking to better understand how adopters find and validate plugins to add to their Backstage instance. </p><p>What we‚Äôve learned is that ‚Äî while the open source plugin ecosystem is very rich and continues to grow ‚Äî&nbsp; there‚Äôs no easy way of understanding which of the 100+ open source plugins are actively maintained, secure, and validated. It‚Äôs also difficult to find the right options when your needs evolve and may not be supported by open source offerings alone. </p><p>Our goal is to make it easy to find what you need throughout your experience using Backstage, and we want to make it easier than ever to add new capabilities. So we‚Äôre investing in a <strong>Spotify Marketplace for Backstage</strong> that will provide a trusted set of resources to help as your organization‚Äôs needs evolve ü§ù. </p><p>The Marketplace will contain solutions from Spotify and trusted third-party partners. All of the capabilities available within our Marketplace will work seamlessly with Quickstart, and will enable users to easily enable add-ons with a few clicks. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="book-a-demo-to-learn-more">Book a demo to learn more<a href="#book-a-demo-to-learn-more" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Book a demo to learn more" title="Direct link to Book a demo to learn more">‚Äã</a></h2><p>We are really excited to share more about these two key features from Spotify. Stay tuned in the next coming months for more details!</p><p>If you‚Äôre itching to (re)watch the webinar, take a look at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-pVOwbgfI0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video on YouTube</a>. </p><p>If you‚Äôre excited about the bundle and want to see the plugins in action, <a href="https://backstage.spotify.com/contact-us/demo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">attend a demo</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

We‚Äôve been busy since launching the Spotify Plugins for Backstage bundle subscription in December, and we‚Äôre excited to share what we‚Äôre building next for Backstage and the bundle. <a href="https://info.backstage.spotify.com/roadmap" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sign up for our commercial roadmap webinar on May 9.</a></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="since-we-last-spoke">Since we last spoke<a href="#since-we-last-spoke" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Since we last spoke" title="Direct link to Since we last spoke">‚Äã</a></h2><p>It‚Äôs been a busy few months since we launched <a href="https://backstage.spotify.com/plugins/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spotify Plugins for Backstage</a> into public beta back in December. Since then, we‚Äôve been busy welcoming new customers and improving the bundle based on the feedback we‚Äôre hearing from you. We‚Äôve learned a lot and are in active development on more than a few exciting products. We can‚Äôt wait to share them with you soon!</p><p>We‚Äôre excited to highlight some recent updates for our <a href="https://backstage.spotify.com/plugins/soundcheck/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Soundcheck</a> plugin in particular. Since launch, we‚Äôve released two new features aimed at making it easier to get up and running with the plugin while also improving your ability to take action on the valuable insights the plugin provides. Most notably, we recently released a <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@spotify/backstage-plugin-soundcheck-backend#fact-framework" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fact Framework</a> and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@spotify/backstage-plugin-soundcheck-backend#third-party-integrations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">third-party integrations</a>. The Fact Framework allows Soundcheck to collect facts (un-opinionated information) about an entity in the software catalog. Facts are made available to Soundcheck through fact collectors. For example, the GitHub fact collector extracts one or more facts about GitHub projects/repositories. Soundcheck can also be extended by registering additional fact collectors. This enables adopters to extend Soundcheck in ways relevant to their organization, systems and infrastructure.</p><p>Together, these two features provide a clearer onramp to navigate checks using best practices (tested and proven at Spotify). Additionally, these new releases will make it easier to expand your programs over time through a growing library of out-of-the-box integrations with first and third-party tools, like the Backstage Software Catalog, GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, and Gerrit.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-weve-learned">What we‚Äôve learned<a href="#what-weve-learned" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What we‚Äôve learned" title="Direct link to What we‚Äôve learned">‚Äã</a></h2><p>In addition to the improvements we‚Äôre making to the plugins themselves, we‚Äôre also excited to share some customer insights from the past few months.</p><ul><li><strong>The Spotify plugins help companies adopt Backstage successfully:</strong> We‚Äôve really enjoyed speaking with current and prospective Backstage adopters around the world on how these plugins can help advance their developer experience goals. We‚Äôre seeing incredible interest for the plugin bundle across all industries, organization sizes, and levels of maturity with Backstage. In many cases with companies early in their Backstage journey, we‚Äôre hearing that Spotify's plugins are integral to moving forward with adoption.</li><li><strong>We have an opportunity to provide deeper opinionation:</strong> We‚Äôre excited to hear partners asking for more guidance from Spotify as it pertains to both Backstage and the plugin bundle. We‚Äôre working to establish stronger signaling within the products and through documentation to make it easier to onboard, leverage best practices, and reduce time-to-value.</li><li><strong>People want more visibility into their Backstage usage:</strong> Customers struggle to understand what users are doing in their Backstage instance and are seeking better tools to measure and monitor, particularly during key adoption phases (for example, encouraging developers to use Backstage frequently and consistently within their organization). We‚Äôre excited for the role the <a href="https://backstage.spotify.com/plugins/insights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Insights</a> plugin is playing here, and looking forward to sharing more features for Insights soon.</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="whats-next-from-spotify">What‚Äôs next from Spotify<a href="#whats-next-from-spotify" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What‚Äôs next from Spotify" title="Direct link to What‚Äôs next from Spotify">‚Äã</a></h2><p>And we‚Äôre just getting started! <a href="https://info.backstage.spotify.com/roadmap" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">You are invited to join our very first Roadmap Webinar</a> on May 9 at 10:00 am EST to hear more about the next steps for Spotify Plugins for Backstage and our commercial offerings.

Backstage Search Platform is a search experience built for you, by you. </p><p>The Backstage Search Platform makes it possible for you to search across your entire software ecosystem. With a Search platform that is customizable and extendable, you can identify your needs within your organization and set up search to solve these problems. Whether it is to search through the Software Catalog or technical documentation generated by the TechDocs plugin. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="so-what-is-backstage-search-10">So what is Backstage Search 1.0?<a href="#so-what-is-backstage-search-10" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to So what is Backstage Search 1.0?" title="Direct link to So what is Backstage Search 1.0?">‚Äã</a></h3><p>Since the first release of the Backstage Search Platform, we have seen a fantastic community grow around the search plugins. To mention just a few of these contributions: </p><ul><li>More search engine modules: <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@backstage/plugin-search-backend-module-elasticsearch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elasticsearch</a> originally <a href="https://github.com/backstage/backstage/pull/6569" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">contributed</a> by Roadie and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@backstage/plugin-search-backend-module-pg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Postgres</a> originally <a href="https://github.com/backstage/backstage/pull/7316" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">contributed</a> by SDA SE</li><li>More components: Quick search modal, originally <a href="https://github.com/backstage/backstage/pull/7316" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">contributed</a> by Expedia Group</li><li>More plugin integrations: TechDocs also <a href="https://github.com/backstage/backstage/pull/6375" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">contributed</a> by Roadie and <a href="https://github.com/backstage/backstage/pull/4515" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Software Catalog</a> </li></ul><p>These are just a few contributions of the countless enhancements and improvements made by contributors across the globe. With a well adopted and tested search platform we feel confident to release Backstage Search as 1.0. </p><p>Packages included in Backstage Search 1.0 release are:</p><p><strong>Core search packages</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@backstage/plugin-search" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@backstage/plugin-search</a>   </li><li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@backstage/plugin-search-react" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@backstage/plugin-search-react  </a>  </li><li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@backstage/plugin-search-common" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@backstage/plugin-search-common</a></li><li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@backstage/plugin-search-backend" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@backstage/plugin-search-backend</a>     </li><li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@backstage/plugin-search-backend-node" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@backstage/plugin-search-backend-node</a></li></ul><p><strong>Modules</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@backstage/plugin-search-backend-module-elasticsearch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@backstage/plugin-search-backend-module-elasticsearch</a></li></ul><p>No additional features are released as part of the major release as the maintainers of the search packages focused on the following for this release: </p><ul><li>Bug fixes and clean up of deprecations.</li><li>Improved error handling for missing indices. </li><li>Separation of AWS Elastic and Open Elastic support.</li><li>Refactor the packages by moving reusable components from <code>@backstage/plugin-search</code> to <code>@backstage/plugin-search-react</code>.</li><li>Improved documentation including tutorials for how to <a href="https://backstage.io/docs/plugins/integrating-search-into-plugins" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Integrate Search into a plugin</a>.</li></ul><p>You might have noticed that the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@backstage/plugin-search-backend-module-pg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@backstage/plugin-search-backend-module-pg</a> package is not part of 1.0. That‚Äôs because that package is a community supported module, and therefore we have not included it as part of 1.0. If you are interested in pushing the Postgres engine to 1.0, feel free to reach out to us in the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/687207715902193673/770283289327566848" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#search</a> channel on Discord.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="elasticsearch-as-the-recommended-engine-for-production-usage">Elasticsearch as the recommended engine for production usage<a href="#elasticsearch-as-the-recommended-engine-for-production-usage" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Elasticsearch as the recommended engine for production usage" title="Direct link to Elasticsearch as the recommended engine for production usage">‚Äã</a></h3><p>When the Backstage Search Platform was first released, it came with an in-memory search engine as default - Lunr. While this is a good engine to use on a smaller scale and for local development (to avoid having to set up a search engine instance separately), it also has its limitations such as: </p><ul><li>Lunr does not scale well. Horizontally scaled deployments of Backstage and/or Backstage Search backend using Lunr result in either duplicated indexing processes and indices or inconsistent index state across nodes.</li><li>Lunr‚Äôs filter functionality is limited, especially for <a href="https://github.com/olivernn/lunr.js/issues/353" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">logical AND/OR operators</a>.</li><li>Lunr has a smaller community than Elasticsearch, which could mean that adopters relying on it will have less by way of resources for iterating on and improving search. </li></ul><p>Therefore, we recommend using Elasticsearch for production usage.  Moving forward, the search maintainers will prioritize the Elasticsearch engine and the community will maintain the Postgres engine. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-to-contribute">How to contribute<a href="#how-to-contribute" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How to contribute" title="Direct link to How to contribute">‚Äã</a></h3><p>If you want to contribute and to further improve search, you can check out the <a href="https://github.com/backstage/backstage/issues?q=is%3Aissue+search+label%3Asearch+is%3Aopen" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open issues labeled with search</a> or reach out to us at the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/687207715902193673/770283289327566848" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#search</a> Discord channel.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-to-get-started">How to get started<a href="#how-to-get-started" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How to get started" title="Direct link to How to get started">‚Äã</a></h3><p>If you haven‚Äôt adopted the Backstage Search Platform yet and feel like now is a good time.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Note: This post was originally published on <a href="https://backstage.io/blog/2021/09/16/the-techdocs-beta-has-landed" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Backstage.io</a>.</em></p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Backstage TechDocs Beta" src="/assets/images/backstage-techdocs-beta-fb1b5f499ed3c3157cae51a9aae2f45b.gif" width="960" height="540" class="img_ev3q"></p><p><strong>TLDR:</strong> Another beta has landed! We continue to focus on improving the stability and scalability of Backstage while enhancing its functionality. Thanks to focused efforts from the TechDocs core team and community, we're happy to say that TechDocs ‚Äî <a href="https://backstage.io/blog/2020/09/08/announcing-tech-docs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our docs-like-code solution</a> for all the software in your catalog ‚Äî is now, after <a href="https://backstage.io/blog/2021/07/26/software-templates-are-now-in-beta" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Software Templates</a>, the second core feature to graduate to beta.</p><p>In addition to new features and improvements, we made numerous compatibility updates ahead of this feature release. You'll find support for a variety of CI systems, cloud storage solutions, and source control systems ‚Äî so that TechDocs works for most orgs, right out of box. But there's much more to explore in this beta, thanks to contributions from the community.</p><p>When we set out to define what beta looked like, we combed through GitHub issues, Discord discussions, and other media to identify common pain points and challenges encountered by those around the world who consume and author TechDocs documentation in their organization's Backstage instance. Based on this research, we put together a user-focused milestone and got to work. For an issue-by-issue breakdown, check out the milestone <a href="https://github.com/backstage/backstage/milestone/29?closed=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on GitHub</a> ‚Äî or, just read on to get the highlights.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="real-time-builds-and-feedback">Real-time builds and feedback<a href="#real-time-builds-and-feedback" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Real-time builds and feedback" title="Direct link to Real-time builds and feedback">‚Äã</a></h2><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Click the refresh button to hot-reload the updated content" src="/assets/images/refresh-button-2e127d36597f8d885f4ccfd4e94dc0ba.gif" width="1855" height="992" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>TechDocs can be transformational once fully up and running (update your code and your docs with the same pull request!). But for first-time users and especially those unfamiliar with the MkDocs ecosystem upon which TechDocs is built, there are often many small, obtuse hurdles that can get in the way of success. Leading up to the beta release, we worked to surface and improve relevant errors and other details during the documentation generation process. Better still, all of this detail is now provided to users <em>in real-time</em>, as docs are generated and refreshed.</p><p>üôå Shout out to Dominik Henneke for implementing the interactive experience.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="custom-homepages-make-techdocs-yours">Custom homepages: Make TechDocs yours<a href="#custom-homepages-make-techdocs-yours" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Custom homepages: Make TechDocs yours" title="Direct link to Custom homepages: Make TechDocs yours">‚Äã</a></h2><p><img loading="lazy" alt="TechDocs custom homepage" src="/assets/images/techdocs-custom-homepage-52e0ff803c9b71f66cf8b192ae11e453.png" width="1822" height="725" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>We strive to make it so that you can mold Backstage into the shape that best fits your organization. With this beta release, just as you can with the Catalog entities and <a href="https://backstage.io/blog/2021/06/24/announcing-backstage-search-platform#composable-search-page-experiences" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Search</a>, you can now customize and compose your own TechDocs homepage. Use it to level up the front page of your Backstage documentation by highlighting golden documentation at your company, or use the new and improved (and Catalog-inspired) experience. Read more about <a href="https://backstage.io/docs/features/techdocs/how-to-guides#how-to-customize-the-techdocs-home-page" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how to customize the TechDocs homepage</a>.</p><p>üôè Thanks to Phil Kuang for the improved default TechDocs home experience</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="simpler-yaml-annotations-whats-in-a-ref">Simpler YAML annotations: What's in a ref?<a href="#simpler-yaml-annotations-whats-in-a-ref" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Simpler YAML annotations: What's in a ref?" title="Direct link to Simpler YAML annotations: What's in a ref?">‚Äã</a></h2><p><img loading="lazy" alt="A simpler techdocs-ref annotation value" src="/assets/images/techdocs-ref-f4fda6f29a3da8e542db2341c6e16c28.png" width="1518" height="589" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>We often forget that in order to enable TechDocs on a Catalog entity, documentation authors have to sprinkle a little ref annotation voodoo into their catalog-info.yaml file. The form of this magic ‚Äî the <code>backstage.io/techdocs-ref</code> annotation ‚Äî has evolved over TechDocs' life. But unless you're a real Backstage aficionado, the specifics of what the value meant and how to construct it could be somewhat of a mystery.</p><p>In the beta, we've simplified this annotation dramatically for documentation authors, aligning its value with TechDocs' docs-like-code philosophy itself. In the vast majority of cases, its value will simply be <code>dir:.</code> ‚Äî which means this catalog entity contains documentation and the mkdocs.yml file describing this documentation lives in the current directory. We continue to support edge cases for <a href="https://backstage.io/docs/features/techdocs/how-to-guides#how-to-understand-techdocs-ref-annotation-values" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">other techdocs-ref annotation values</a>, as well.</p><p>üëè Another round of applause for Dominik for driving this improvement through.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="everything-neat-and-tidy">Everything neat and tidy<a href="#everything-neat-and-tidy" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Everything neat and tidy" title="Direct link to Everything neat and tidy">‚Äã</a></h2><p>If you've ever twitched a little looking at the address bar as you navigated through your TechDocs, because the "C" in "Component" was capitalized, or cringed whilst perusing through your TechDocs storage bucket, only to see assets you definitely remember deleting from a documentation site cluttering up the place‚Ä¶twitch and cringe no more!</p><p>TechDocs base paths are now case-insensitive, stale files are automatically cleaned up by the TechDocs publishing process ‚Äî and even though <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/6NDaYWg85ZnJ3Ae0WkILWh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I say <em>.yaml</em> and you say <em>.yml</em></a> ‚Äî TechDocs will now happily accept either file extension for your MkDocs YAML file.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-should-i-do-to-upgrade">What should I do to upgrade?<a href="#what-should-i-do-to-upgrade" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What should I do to upgrade?" title="Direct link to What should I do to upgrade?">‚Äã</a></h2><p>If you've been waiting for the beta to give TechDocs a shot, good news! You'll get all of the above, plus all of TechDocs' existing features, right out of the box. Newly created Backstage apps come ready-to-go. You'll know you're on beta if you're using the following versions:</p><ul><li>TechDocs Plugin version &gt;= 0.11.0</li><li>TechDocs Backend Plugin version &gt;= 0.10.0</li><li>TechDocs CLI version &gt;= 0.7.0</li></ul><p>If you're upgrading from a prior, alpha version of TechDocs, be aware that there are some breaking changes that you will need to account for. Most importantly:</p><ul><li>Be sure your app's instance of TechDocs is wired up to use the composability API. <a href="https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/packages/create-app/CHANGELOG.md#0338" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">See full routing instructions here</a>.</li><li>If you've configured TechDocs to publish generated content to a remote storage solution provider like AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Azure Blob Storage, you will need to use the TechDocs CLI to migrate the contents of your storage bucket. <a href="https://backstage.io/docs/features/techdocs/how-to-guides#how-to-migrate-from-techdocs-alpha-to-beta" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">See full migration instructions here</a>.</li><li>In order to take advantage of the stale file deletion functionality, you may need to add some permissions to the account or role used by your TechDocs backend to publish contents to your storage provider. <a href="https://backstage.io/docs/features/techdocs/using-cloud-storage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">See "Using Cloud Storage docs"</a> for updated permissions recommendations.</li></ul><p>Thanks again to the whole community for hitting this milestone with us!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Note: This post was originally published on <a href="https://backstage.io/blog/2021/07/26/software-templates-are-now-in-beta" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Backstage.io</a>.</em></p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Software Templates in Beta" src="/assets/images/backstage-software-templates-beta-e96cede6e6b3984bc58a51ec33f37b1c.gif" width="960" height="540" class="img_ev3q"></p><p><strong>TLDR</strong>; At a high level, Backstage performs three main jobs: <a href="https://backstage.io/blog/2021/05/20/adopting-backstage#three-jobs-create-manage-explore" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Create, Manage, and Explore</a>. Throughout the year, we‚Äôve been focussed on improving the stability and scalability of these areas while enhancing the feature sets based upon requests from the community. Software Templates ‚Äî which enable push-button deployments with all your standards and best practices built-in ‚Äî is our first feature-complete release candidate to graduate to beta. Read on to learn how this release improves template customization and flexibility, as well as performance.</p><p>Let‚Äôs rewind a little bit, around a year in fact. Backstage had been open sourced, and we released our first version of Software Templates and our Scaffolder plugin.</p><p>In case you missed it, <a href="https://backstage.io/blog/2020/08/05/announcing-backstage-software-templates" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Software Templates</a> are part of the Create feature set, where you can set up Backstage to give your engineers the ability to spin up a new microservice, website, or any other software component with your organization‚Äôs best practices built-in, right from the start.</p><p>Back when we released the first version of these templates, with the <code>apiVersion</code> <code>backstage.io/v1alpha1</code>, they were a little restrictive in what they could do. The generated repository could only have one template source and it was restricted to only being <a href="https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cookiecutter</a> templates. And it had to fit into the three stages of templating which was <code>Prepare</code>, <code>Template</code>, and <code>Publish</code>.</p><p>We <a href="https://github.com/backstage/backstage/issues/2771" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">opened up for feedback</a> from the community knowing that this wasn‚Äôt going to be the final version, but something of a stepping stone to where we want to be in the future.</p><p>And now we come to today‚Ä¶</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="anddddd-actions-">Anddddd‚Ä¶ Action(s)! üé¨<a href="#anddddd-actions-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Anddddd‚Ä¶ Action(s)! üé¨" title="Direct link to Anddddd‚Ä¶ Action(s)! üé¨">‚Äã</a></h2><p>Following the removal of the previously deprecated <code>backstage.io/v1alpha1</code> templates, today we‚Äôre officially announcing the beta version of Software Templates, or <code>backstage.io/v1beta2</code>.</p><p>With it comes an entirely new architecture to the Software Templates functionality, and a load of new exciting features, which I‚Äôll dig into a little deeper.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="template-actions">Template actions<a href="#template-actions" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Template actions" title="Direct link to Template actions">‚Äã</a></h3><p>We‚Äôve totally opened up the ability to compose your own workflows for each Template that you have registered in Software Templates. This means no restrictions on where your template skeleton is kept, and no restrictions on what your workflow should look like.</p><p>Template Actions are customizable JavaScript functions that allow you to extend the capabilities of the Software Templates by adding your own business logic or reusing some of our Built-In actions.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="New template syntax with actions" src="/assets/images/example-template-code-36716b699eaed4fad8a8206e38ccdee9.png" title="An example of the new template syntax with steps and parameters" width="640" height="1228" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The workflow for Software Templates are now step-based, and each Software Template can have a customizable amount of steps which will in turn call these new actions.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="New steps being rendered in the frontend" src="/assets/images/steps-running-b4ac03c38b16e1d6af751d029a525f50.gif" title="An example of a Template with customizable steps" width="800" height="449" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>These actions are very heavily inspired by GitHub Actions and GitHub Workflows, and we‚Äôve given back a lot of control to the template authors so they can build the boilerplate and push the code however they want.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="custom-ui-extensions">Custom UI extensions<a href="#custom-ui-extensions" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Custom UI extensions" title="Direct link to Custom UI extensions">‚Äã</a></h3><p>A large part of the Software Templates feature is the form that we use to collect user input which is then passed on to these new actions. Sometimes, it makes sense that Template Authors want to provide their own React components which can be rendered in the frontend to maybe do some more complex things like calling internal APIs to provide autocomplete.</p><p>This is now possible with the new <code>ScaffolderFieldExtensions</code>.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Custom UI extensions" src="/assets/images/custom-components-521c107f29bb24a8940e0ea5251019a9.gif" title="An example of `ScaffolderFieldExtension` is the `OwnerPicker` component which can automatically add options and suggest typeahead with data from an async API request" width="600" height="264" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Template Authors can create their own components to provide data to the custom actions in any way you see fit, and even override our own built in ones too like the <code>RepoUrlPicker</code>.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="horizontal-scalability">Horizontal scalability<a href="#horizontal-scalability" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Horizontal scalability" title="Direct link to Horizontal scalability">‚Äã</a></h3><p>The Scaffolder Service and Software Templates are now horizontally scalable, coordinating work between your deployed backend machines. This means now that the number of instances of the <code>@backstage/plugin-scaffolder-backend</code> plugin you have, is the same amount of jobs that you can have in parallel. This ensures that your tasks are handled quickly and reliably, while providing great feedback in the process.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="try-out-the-new-templates">Try out the new templates<a href="#try-out-the-new-templates" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Try out the new templates" title="Direct link to Try out the new templates">‚Äã</a></h2><p>We‚Äôre still on the journey to making the Software Templates a great user experience for both authors and developers ‚Äî but we‚Äôre not done yet, so watch this space for new exciting features to come!</p><p>In the meantime, make sure to visit the documentation for <a href="https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-templates/adding-templates" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">building templates</a> or creating your own <a href="https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-templates/writing-custom-actions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">custom actions</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Note: This post was originally published on <a href="https://backstage.io/blog/2021/06/24/announcing-backstage-search-platform" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Backstage.io</a></em></p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Backstage Search platform" src="/assets/images/backstage-search-platform-a2c925e7e7fa9aa3cc6e1e24d01bce7d.png" width="8002" height="4502" class="img_ev3q"></p><p><strong>TLDR;</strong> The new Backstage Search is now available in alpha, ready for you to start building on. A total rethinking of the core search feature in Backstage, it‚Äôs more than just a box you type into ‚Äî it‚Äôs a mini platform all by itself. With its composable frontend and extensible backend, you can design and build the search tool that suits your organization‚Äôs needs.</p><p>So, you don‚Äôt just get an improved out-of-the-box experience for searching whatever is in your software catalog. You can also add support for searching other sources, too. Customize it the way you want and you can search your catalog, your plugins and docs ‚Äî and even external sources, like Stack Overflow and Confluence ‚Äî all at once, all right inside Backstage.</p><p>With one query, your teams can find exactly what they‚Äôre looking for: anything and everything.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="search-and-explore">Search and explore<a href="#search-and-explore" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Search and explore" title="Direct link to Search and explore">‚Äã</a></h2><p>Being able to easily explore your ecosystem ‚Äî to discover software, tools, documentation, and other valuable knowledge ‚Äî is one of <a href="https://backstage.io/blog/2021/05/20/adopting-backstage#three-jobs-create-manage-explore" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the three main jobs of Backstage</a>. Teams should be able to find what other teams have already built, so they can reuse and contribute to components instead of unknowingly duplicating them. Data endpoints should be shared, not siloed away. Services and their APIs should be easily discoverable. Best practices and technical documentation should be easily found.</p><p>Along with the <a href="https://backstage.io/blog/2020/06/22/backstage-service-catalog-alpha" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Backstage Service Catalog</a>, Backstage Search is essential to enabling this discoverability ‚Äî allowing new hires and old hands alike to explore your infrastructure instead of getting lost inside it.</p><p>We also quickly realized that search looks different from organization to organization. Therefore, we built a search platform that lets you plug in your own search engine, index any information you like, or build a customized search page experience that fits your users‚Äô needs.</p><p>Since finding what you are looking for in Backstage is critical for success, we started by identifying the needs and goals of search.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="rethinking-search-inside-and-out">Rethinking search, inside and out<a href="#rethinking-search-inside-and-out" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Rethinking search, inside and out" title="Direct link to Rethinking search, inside and out">‚Äã</a></h2><p>Spotify‚Äôs internal version of Backstage has had some of the features of Backstage Search for a while, and open sourcing them has been top of mind since day one. But we didn‚Äôt want to just port our internal version to the open source version. We wanted to take the opportunity to apply what we‚Äôve learned inside Spotify over the last year, address the needs we‚Äôve observed in the community, and ultimately open source not just a search feature but a search platform. We started the process by looking at the <a href="https://hbr.org/2016/09/know-your-customers-jobs-to-be-done" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">jobs to be done</a>.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Backstage Search platform" src="/assets/images/jobs-to-be-done-017935cc673ca82e9d43760ab2acbcbf.png" title="A high-level overview of the process, identifying all the jobs of search." width="8122" height="2975" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>First, we looked at which jobs to be done belonged to the search plugin itself (e.g., ‚Äúcollect documents to index‚Äù) and which belonged to the other plugins (e.g., ‚Äúformat documents for indexing‚Äù), and then whether those jobs belonged to the frontend (‚Äúdisplay results‚Äù) or the backend (‚Äúschedule indexing‚Äù).</p><p>Looking at all these various jobs, we defined four goals for the platform:</p><ul><li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Be search engine‚Äìagnostic</li><li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> Make it easy for content owners to make their content searchable/discoverable</li><li><strong>Control:</strong> Allow plugin developers to customize their search results components</li><li><strong>Reusability:</strong> Offer reusable components/APIs that other devs can leverage</li></ul><p>Beginning our journey this way ‚Äî by identifying the jobs to be done first, then defining the product goals from there ‚Äî we could make sure that the search platform addressed real needs and improved the search experience for both users and plugin developers.</p><p>This approach not only created a better search tool for the open source community, but for Spotify, as well. So, instead of just open sourcing our internal version of search, we ended up with an even better solution ‚Äî one that we can all use and build on together, both inside and outside Spotify.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="say-hello-to-the-backstage-search-platform">Say hello to the Backstage Search platform<a href="#say-hello-to-the-backstage-search-platform" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Say hello to the Backstage Search platform" title="Direct link to Say hello to the Backstage Search platform">‚Äã</a></h2><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Backstage Search platform" src="/assets/images/search-results-7958b00b1c30bfeb3de84cb5707cf5da.png" width="1230" height="681" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>We are now happy and proud to announce our alpha version of the <a href="https://backstage.io/docs/features/search/architecture" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Backstage Search Platform</a>, featuring:</p><ul><li>Bring your own search engine (Flexibility)</li><li>Collators for easily indexing content from plugins and other sources (Simplicity)</li><li>Composable search page experiences (Control, Reusability)</li><li>Customize the look and feel of each search result (Control, Reusability)</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="bring-your-own-search-engine">Bring your own search engine<a href="#bring-your-own-search-engine" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Bring your own search engine" title="Direct link to Bring your own search engine">‚Äã</a></h3><p>By introducing a Search Integration Layer, we have been able to keep the query translation of the search term and filters close to the search engine itself. This makes our search backend less focused on how a set of terms and filters should be translated to fit a certain search engine interface and more focused on querying and retrieving results as well as collecting results to index.</p><p>With the Search Integration Layer, your organization can bring your search engine of choice to Backstage ‚Äî instead of relying on Backstage to support a specific search engine that might not fit the needs of your organization, either today or in the future.</p><p>But that doesn‚Äôt mean ‚Äúbatteries not included‚Äù. The current version of Backstage Search ships with Lunr support built-in ‚Äî and support for ElasticSearch is not very far off. And we hope the number of supported search engines will continue to grow with the community‚Äôs help.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="collators-for-easily-indexing-content-from-plugins-and-other-sources">Collators for easily indexing content from plugins and other sources<a href="#collators-for-easily-indexing-content-from-plugins-and-other-sources" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Collators for easily indexing content from plugins and other sources" title="Direct link to Collators for easily indexing content from plugins and other sources">‚Äã</a></h3><p>Since Backstage‚Äôs functionality comes from its plugins, we wanted the process of making plugin content searchable to be as frictionless as possible. Therefore we decided on a concept we call collators. Collators are responsible for collecting documents to index from a plugin. Your collators live inside your own plugin, but are registered in the Backstage app‚Äôs search backend.</p><p>Collators can also be used to index external sources, like Stack Overflow and Confluence. You can watch a demo of how easy it is to extend search with collators <a href="https://youtu.be/Z78FFaObTfk?t=339" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="composable-search-page-experiences">Composable search page experiences<a href="#composable-search-page-experiences" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Composable search page experiences" title="Direct link to Composable search page experiences">‚Äã</a></h3><p>Every engineering org has different needs ‚Äî that is something we have definitely learned over the last year. Your software catalog might be set up differently than ours and therefore your needs for how search results look and how the search filters work will also differ.</p><p>That's why we have put effort into making your search page experience composable to your organization's needs. What do we mean by that? When you adopt Backstage and set up your app, you can set up ‚Äî or, compose ‚Äî your search page by using existing components or by creating your own custom ones.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="customize-the-look-and-feel-of-each-search-result">Customize the look and feel of each search result<a href="#customize-the-look-and-feel-of-each-search-result" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Customize the look and feel of each search result" title="Direct link to Customize the look and feel of each search result">‚Äã</a></h3><p>A good example of the level of customization the platform allows is how list items are displayed in search results. A search result component can be a list, this list can consist of different list items (search results returned from the search engine) ‚Äî but these list items could look different depending on what the search result returns in terms of its fields.</p><p>Let‚Äôs say that for an entity returned from the software catalog maybe the most important information to show is the name, while a result returned from the TechDocs plugin should maybe show the text content as the most important information. This can be customized by creating </p><div></div> components (like TechDocsResultListItem or CatalogResultListItem or whatever list item component you want) and configuring them in the app.<p></p><p>If there is no need to customize your search result list items, the </p><div></div> component is there for you to reuse.<p></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="getting-started-with-backstage-search">Getting started with Backstage Search<a href="#getting-started-with-backstage-search" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Getting started with Backstage Search" title="Direct link to Getting started with Backstage Search">‚Äã</a></h2><p>We put together <a href="https://backstage.io/docs/features/search/getting-started" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a getting started guide</a> that provides two different ways to set up Backstage Search:</p><ul><li>Create a new app and get the most out of the search setup right out of the box, or</li><li>Add the new Backstage Search setup to your existing Backstage app.</li></ul><p>Whichever situation you‚Äôre in, we have you covered.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="whats-next">What‚Äôs next?<a href="#whats-next" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What‚Äôs next?" title="Direct link to What‚Äôs next?">‚Äã</a></h2><p>We‚Äôve built the foundation for the Backstage Search platform, and we can't wait to see the exciting engines, collators, and components the community builds on the platform.</p><p>You can check out our <a href="https://backstage.io/docs/features/search/search-overview#project-roadmap" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">project roadmap</a> in our search documentation or track the progress of our <a href="https://github.com/backstage/backstage/milestone/27" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Beta milestone</a> and <a href="https://github.com/backstage/backstage/milestone/28" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GA milestone</a>.</p><p>For any questions, feedback or ideas about the Backstage Search platform, join us in the #search channel on <a href="https://discord.gg/backstage-687207715902193673" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord</a>!</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[In addition to the open source plugins that we‚Äôll continue to release for Backstage, we‚Äôre going to begin offering Spotify-built paid plugins.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" alt="New Spotify plugins coming next year" src="/assets/images/spotify-paid-plugins-4e32439bcd445bf786478168b1254de9.png" width="1200" height="630" class="img_ev3q"></p><p><strong>TLDR:</strong> Next year, Spotify is going to start selling some new plugins we build for Backstage. We‚Äôre doubling down on Backstage with a sustainable business model as the cornerstone to our long-term commitment to the project. Following in the footsteps of the most successful open source projects, our goal is to pave a path for careers and companies to be born out of Backstage.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="sustaining-our-investment-and-expanding-the-ecosystem">Sustaining our investment and expanding the ecosystem<a href="#sustaining-our-investment-and-expanding-the-ecosystem" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Sustaining our investment and expanding the ecosystem" title="Direct link to Sustaining our investment and expanding the ecosystem">‚Äã</a></h2><p>The open source version of Backstage began as a humble Spotify Hack Week project but, as the project has grown, so have our goals. We want to make Backstage the standard developer portal platform across the industry to help developers everywhere be happier and more effective.</p><p>All along, we‚Äôve believed the best way to achieve that goal is by fostering a thriving ecosystem around the platform. Today we‚Äôre excited to share the next step in expanding that ecosystem: starting next year, Spotify will begin offering paid plugins for Backstage. This will allow us to bring even more of our expertise and experience to the platform.</p><p>We love Backstage. We depend on Backstage. Right now, only a small portion of the value that Backstage provides within Spotify is available to people outside of Spotify. And as the project has evolved, we‚Äôve heard from adopters and contributors alike that Spotify‚Äôs experience and maturity with Backstage is one of the platform‚Äôs key differentiators.</p><p>Adding paid plugins from Spotify to the other commercial services surrounding Backstage will make the platform more valuable to current adopters (Spotify included), broaden its reach to new adopters, and create a more diverse ecosystem for the community at large.</p><p>And revenue generated from paid plugins can be reinvested into developing more plugins and evolving Backstage. And the beat goes on!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="spotify-built-spotify-tested">Spotify-built, Spotify-tested<a href="#spotify-built-spotify-tested" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Spotify-built, Spotify-tested" title="Direct link to Spotify-built, Spotify-tested">‚Äã</a></h2><p>Over the years, we‚Äôve learned a lot about how to improve developer experience with Backstage ‚Äî and we can‚Äôt wait to bring even more of those ideas and insights to your teams.</p><p>This new category of plugins ‚Äî built and sold by Spotify ‚Äî will come in two flavors:</p><ol><li><strong>Tried and true:</strong> Beloved plugins we‚Äôve been using internally with great success and have been battle-tested by our own internal developer community.</li><li><strong>New and improved:</strong> Brand-new plugin concepts that we think will unlock value for engineering orgs adopting Backstage.</li></ol><p>While Spotify will retain ownership and licensing of these plugins, there‚Äôs no doubt that we also plan to keep contributing open source plugins to the community. We want to keep the momentum on the open source project, while also adding rocket fuel by unlocking more plugin possibilities.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="more-paid-plugins-more-free-plugins--more-value-for-everyone">More paid plugins, more free plugins ‚Äî more value for everyone<a href="#more-paid-plugins-more-free-plugins--more-value-for-everyone" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to More paid plugins, more free plugins ‚Äî more value for everyone" title="Direct link to More paid plugins, more free plugins ‚Äî more value for everyone">‚Äã</a></h2><p>If this business model sounds familiar (hello Freemium!), that‚Äôs because it's a core part of our company mission: to unlock the human potential and creativity out there in the world. We believe developers need a better experience, just like everyone should enjoy music and audio in the ways they want to listen.</p><p>Our intention is to keep adding new plugins to our commercial offering over time. But to be clear ‚Äî SPOTIFY IS NOT MOVING AWAY FROM OPEN SOURCE CONTRIBUTIONS OR THE BACKSTAGE COMMUNITY. Sorry for getting shouty, but we really don‚Äôt want the community we love to get the wrong idea. In fact, it‚Äôs really the opposite.</p><p>We‚Äôre doubling down on Backstage, and paid plugins enable Spotify to continue to grow our investment in the open source project and community.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="coming-soon-to-a-repo-near-you--sign-up-now">Coming soon to a repo near you ‚Äî sign up now<a href="#coming-soon-to-a-repo-near-you--sign-up-now" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Coming soon to a repo near you ‚Äî sign up now" title="Direct link to Coming soon to a repo near you ‚Äî sign up now">‚Äã</a></h2><p>We‚Äôll be talking through our commercialization plan a bit more at this week‚Äôs <a href="https://github.com/backstage/community/issues/34" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Backstage Community Session</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" alt="preview image for blog post" src="/assets/images/preview-198451d81ca44a377db4a5f58b1d5143.png" width="2500" height="1313" class="img_ev3q"></p><p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> The Spotify Plugins for Backstage subscription is here! We‚Äôre delighted to offer a bundle that encapsulates the plugins needed to level up your Backstage developer portal. You can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLf1KFlSkDLIA2n67Fk87svXvTi2vczEXT" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">watch our launch event</a> or just <a href="https://backstage.spotify.com/contact-us/demo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">get started with our plugins</a>.</p><p>We‚Äôre delighted to share that our <a href="https://backstage.spotify.com/plugins/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spotify Plugins for Backstage bundle subscription</a> is now available in open beta to all Backstage adopters. After years of research and iterating, we‚Äôve created hundreds of Backstage plugins at Spotify, and this bundle of five plugins represents the very best of what we‚Äôve built.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="unblocking-developer-experience">Un(b)locking developer experience<a href="#unblocking-developer-experience" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Un(b)locking developer experience" title="Direct link to Un(b)locking developer experience">‚Äã</a></h3><p>At Spotify, we are obsessed with how to create a better experience for our developers. Our company mission is to unlock human potential and creativity. We‚Äôve said it before and we‚Äôll say it again for the cheap seats in the back: Developers are creators!</p><p>Every company is a software company. So every company has to ensure their software developers are able to do their best work. At Spotify, we‚Äôve been on a multi-year journey toward this concept of developer effectiveness, which we believe is a function of two things: productivity and happiness.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="developer effectiveness equation" src="/assets/images/Effectiveness_equation-6f0ee8333744128035205c19be9ab89a.png" width="2056" height="276" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Sure, we all want productivity. Now more than ever, we need to figure out how to do more with less. But maybe more importantly, how do you turn the spotlight on the humans in your organization and find out if they‚Äôre empowered? If their energy is being applied in healthy ways? And if they have what they need to experiment, try new things, and innovate? That‚Äôs developer satisfaction (aka happiness). We want to help you have both.</p><p>This focus on developer effectiveness has helped Spotify realize more than 10% year-over-year increases in developer productivity with employee engagement and retention rates well over industry averages. And in the three years since we open sourced the Backstage platform, we‚Äôve spoken with hundreds of companies who are all in pursuit of the same goals.</p><p>So if you want developer effectiveness, you‚Äôre in the right place. The Spotify Plugins for Backstage bundle is the next step toward Spotify‚Äôs goal to share what we‚Äôve learned with the world. We‚Äôre confident these plugins will take each and every developer portal built on Backstage to the next level, by making developers in your organization happier and more productive.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="level-up-your-backstage-app">Level up your Backstage app<a href="#level-up-your-backstage-app" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Level up your Backstage app" title="Direct link to Level up your Backstage app">‚Äã</a></h3><p>Don‚Äôt just take it from me: Earlier today, we hosted our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLf1KFlSkDLIA2n67Fk87svXvTi2vczEXT" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">launch event</a> where we heard directly from the Spotify plugin creators and Backstage users.

Even more answers! What were the technical decisions the Spotify team considered/reconsidered/forgot to consider before releasing Backstage into the wild? Why were some on the team actually relieved when they were given <em>less</em> time to build the open source version?

            <description><![CDATA[Let‚Äôs talk metrics. How can you tell if you‚Äôre improving developer experience and effectiveness? Here‚Äôs how we do it at Spotify.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Speed? Satisfaction? How do you measure Backstage success?" src="/assets/images/measuring-success-b9bad72a9739ae205e2d2c4c7d304be8.png" width="1800" height="945" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Within the Backstage community, much of the conversation centers on <a href="https://backstage.io/docs/overview/adopting" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">strategies for adopting</a> a developer portal. But, we believe it‚Äôs equally important to discuss what to do once you‚Äôve made the decision to adopt Backstage. In essence, how can you gauge whether Backstage is moving the needle on improving software development processes? More importantly, how do you measure improvements to developer experience and developer effectiveness?</p><p>The answer ‚Äî like most when it comes to Backstage ‚Äî is there is no one-size-fits-all approach. So we‚Äôll start with what we know and what we‚Äôve done internally at Spotify. (In our next post, we‚Äôll look at how our friends at Expedia Group go about it.)</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="productivity-vs-efficiency-vs-effectiveness">Productivity vs efficiency vs effectiveness<a href="#productivity-vs-efficiency-vs-effectiveness" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Productivity vs efficiency vs effectiveness" title="Direct link to Productivity vs efficiency vs effectiveness">‚Äã</a></h2><p>Let‚Äôs start with terminology. This may seem pretty basic, but software development is a human-intensive process. Much of its success hinges on a developer‚Äôs <em>productivity</em> and <em>efficiency</em>. These terms are often used interchangeably but they are actually different metrics:</p><ul><li><strong>Developer productivity</strong> is the ratio of output (i.e., the quantity of work completed) to input (i.e. effort, time). This metric is easy to measure, but it doesn‚Äôt tell the whole story.</li><li><strong>Developer efficiency</strong> is measured by the amount of resources (i.e., time, computation power, human resources) used per unit of best possible output. It accounts for all the input required, so you can see if the team is doing enough of the right kind of work.</li></ul><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Productivity = size of developed software/software development effort. Efficiency = size of developed software/resources used." src="/assets/images/productivity-vs-efficiency-b677323c132a2e6a014db532b3cb1995.png" width="1800" height="663" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>So which one do you need to track in order to determine if your development processes have improved? The answer is both, since productivity focuses on quantity and efficiency focuses on quality. You want a high quantity of output that works as intended or better.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="developer-effectiveness">Developer effectiveness<a href="#developer-effectiveness" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Developer effectiveness" title="Direct link to Developer effectiveness">‚Äã</a></h3><p>At Spotify, we also hinge a lot of our success on a third metric: <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/en-us/insights/podcasts/technology-podcasts/developer-effectiveness" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>developer effectiveness</strong></a>. If building and shipping code is a human-intensive process, effectiveness measures productivity and efficiency but also takes a qualitative look at the human beings in your org. Do people feel empowered to do their best work? Is their energy being applied in healthy ways to both their own goals and the company‚Äôs goals? Is it easy to innovate, experiment, and try new things? Effectiveness evaluates important contexts that allow your organization to address low morale, stress/burnout, and other factors that can contribute to poorer quality and high turnover in the long term.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-we-approach-metrics">How we approach metrics<a href="#how-we-approach-metrics" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How we approach metrics" title="Direct link to How we approach metrics">‚Äã</a></h2><p>So how do we measure productivity, efficiency, and effectiveness, along with other indicators that can tell you about the quality of the overall developer experience?</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="time-to-10th-pr">Time-to-10th PR<a href="#time-to-10th-pr" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Time-to-10th PR" title="Direct link to Time-to-10th PR">‚Äã</a></h3><p>Before we built Backstage in 2016, Spotify was in <a href="https://engineering.atspotify.com/2021/05/18/a-product-story-the-lessons-of-backstage-and-spotifys-autonomous-culture/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a hyper-growth period</a> and hiring engineers at a breakneck pace. But when we took a look at metrics, we saw our productivity wasn‚Äôt getting better, despite all the new hires. Specifically, when we looked at our onboarding metric ‚Äî <strong>which we measure as time-to-merge your 10th pull request</strong> ‚Äî we saw it had ballooned to 60 days.</p><p>As we built Backstage, our north star metric was reducing that onboarding time. And it fell quickly to less than 20 days for a new joiner to merge their 10th PR. Even though you may not be onboarding new engineers as rapidly as we were, this metric is a great proxy for the overall complexity of your ecosystem. And reducing it benefits your whole engineering organization, since longtime team members don‚Äôt get tapped on the shoulder as often.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="proxy-metrics">Proxy metrics<a href="#proxy-metrics" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Proxy metrics" title="Direct link to Proxy metrics">‚Äã</a></h3><p><img loading="lazy" alt="86% of internal users are satisfied with Backstage. 80% of contributions are from outside the core team. 150+ plugins contributed from 100+ squads." src="/assets/images/spotify-backstage-metrics-e02e651811e60812f300f0efa6908141.png" width="1200" height="311" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>We also focus on a few other important proxy metrics for our internal version of Backstage, ranging from feedback from our quarterly developer surveys to more traditional metrics, like daily active users.</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Metric</strong></th><th><strong>Description</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>What our developers are saying</td><td>Every quarter we receive feedback through EngSat ‚Äî Spotify‚Äôs official engineering satisfaction survey.</td></tr><tr><td>Plugin contributions</td><td>We look at the total number of plugins developed, how many plugin contributions are coming from teams outside the core Backstage team, and the total number of teams that have contributed at least one plugin.</td></tr><tr><td>Ease of discovery</td><td>Or, in other words, an individual contributor‚Äôs ability to go from being stuck to unstuck in just a few minutes. We find that it's extremely important for a growing engineering org to maintain a shared knowledge base that‚Äôs easy to navigate and explore with the help of <a href="https://backstage.io/docs/features/search/search-overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Search</a>. At Spotify, we use metrics like search success rates, click-through rates, and search results relevance.</td></tr><tr><td>Reduced context switching</td><td>Reducing context switching can help engineers stay in the "zone". We measure the number of different tools an engineer has to interact with in order to get a certain job done (i.e. push a change, follow it into production and validate it did not break anything).</td></tr><tr><td>Traditional metrics</td><td>These metrics include visits (monthly active users, daily active users, etc.) and page views. Most Spotify engineers visit Backstage on a daily basis.</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="more-metrics-to-consider">More metrics to consider<a href="#more-metrics-to-consider" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to More metrics to consider" title="Direct link to More metrics to consider">‚Äã</a></h2><p>Below you‚Äôll find a list of other metrics that you can use to verify if Backstage has a successful impact on your software development process.</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Metric</strong></th><th><strong>Description</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Number of merges per developer/day</td><td>Less time spent jumping between different tools and looking for information means more time to focus on shipping code. A second level of bottlenecks can be identified if you categorize contributions by domain (services, web, data, etc).</td></tr><tr><td>Deploys to production</td><td>A close cousin to the metric above. How many times does an engineer push changes into production?</td></tr><tr><td>MTTR</td><td>With clear ownership of all the pieces in your microservices ecosystem and all tools integrated into one place, Backstage makes it quicker for teams to find the root cause of failures and fix them.</td></tr><tr><td>T-shapedness</td><td>A <a href="https://medium.com/@jchyip/why-t-shaped-people-e8706198e437" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">T-shaped</a> engineer is someone who is able to contribute to different domains of engineering. Teams with T-shaped people have fewer bottlenecks and can therefore deliver more consistently. Backstage makes it easier to be T-shaped since tools and infrastructure are consistent between domains, and information is available centrally.</td></tr><tr><td>Fragmentation</td><td><a href="https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-templates/software-templates-index" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Software Templates</a> help drive standardization in your software ecosystem. By measuring the variance in technology between different software components, it's possible to get a sense of the overall fragmentation in your ecosystem. Examples could include: framework versions, languages, deployment methods and various code quality measurements.</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ymmv-your-metrics-may-vary">YMMV: Your metrics may vary<a href="#ymmv-your-metrics-may-vary" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to YMMV: Your metrics may vary" title="Direct link to YMMV: Your metrics may vary">‚Äã</a></h2><p>There is no universal answer on how to measure Backstage success, but we believe that a healthy mix of qualitative and quantitative metrics mapped to your organization‚Äôs goals are key to that evaluation. We‚Äôre excited to hear more from our friends at Expedia on how they‚Äôre approaching proof-of-value as they roll out Backstage.</p>]]></content:encoded>

An amazing partnership blossomed between Spotify, EG, and the broader adopter community as we evolved Backstage for our internal implementation and contributions to Backstage open source.</p><p>An important question emerged as Backstage continues to gain momentum with our 6K+ developer community at EG ‚Äî how to show the value of Backstage to them in a meaningful way?</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="lets-first-examine-the-eg-internal-developer-journey">Let‚Äôs first examine the EG internal developer journey<a href="#lets-first-examine-the-eg-internal-developer-journey" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Let‚Äôs first examine the EG internal developer journey" title="Direct link to Let‚Äôs first examine the EG internal developer journey">‚Äã</a></h2><p>The EG Developer Experience Team is part of a broader organization called Development Platform &amp; Infrastructure that was chartered to simplify the developer journey.</p><p>We kicked off a journey map workshop to refine our developer journey map representing the next 6‚Äì12 month horizon.

These jobs to be done follow a user story format. An example JTBD looks like ‚ÄúWhen onboarding as a developer, I want intuitive search so that I can discover EG Platform content quickly.‚Äù</p><p>This JTBD exercise enables a common steel thread exercise, which means testing developer JTBD on the critical path with an aim to reduce friction.

What we forget about (unless a light blows out or an amp malfunctions) is the team of people behind the scenes ‚Äî all those technicians and artisans running around in the wings and rafters, wrangling cables, adjusting sliders, and hoisting lighting rigs ‚Äî all to ensure the performance we see on stage is a great one. </p><p>When we named our internal developer portal Backstage, it felt like an apt metaphor for technology that helps power the world‚Äôs largest audio streaming service. Backstage was built to address a near-universal challenge of complexity. To abstract away the messy parts of a sprawling, fragmented tech ecosystem and give space for developers to focus on what they do best: creating. Backstage is what enables great performances from our developers.</p><p>In the nearly three years since Spotify open sourced it, Backstage has become a mature and thriving platform for companies building their own developer portals. We‚Äôre now seeing 400+ adopters and 1500+ contributors across the globe using the core framework to create better experiences for hundreds of thousands of their fellow developers. Backstage has been adopted by enterprise companies in healthcare, gaming, manufacturing, government, and more. Companies that look and feel a lot like Spotify <em>and</em> companies that don‚Äôt. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="spotify-plugins-for-backstage-a-bundle-of-productivity">Spotify Plugins for Backstage: A bundle of productivity<a href="#spotify-plugins-for-backstage-a-bundle-of-productivity" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Spotify Plugins for Backstage: A bundle of productivity" title="Direct link to Spotify Plugins for Backstage: A bundle of productivity">‚Äã</a></h3><p>Our goal has always been pretty simple: we want to make Backstage a critical part of everyday workflow to help developers everywhere be happier and more effective. That‚Äôs why Backstage is an open source platform and why Spotify is continuing to build with and support the open source community. Last year, when we <a href="https://backstage.spotify.com/blog/paid-plugins-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">first shared our intent to commercialize</a> products for Backstage, we talked about how we've only just begun tapping into the potential of Backstage and sharing all that it has done for us at Spotify. </p><p>Today, I‚Äôm happy to share the next step on that journey: Spotify Plugins for Backstage ‚Äî a paid subscription that will soon be available to all Backstage adopters. The bundle subscription includes two kinds of plugins: (1) new external versions of some of the most popular plugins we‚Äôve been using inside Spotify for years, and (2) plugins specifically created to unlock more value for companies using Backstage. All of these premium plugins complement the open source plugins we already provide, bringing even more of Spotify‚Äôs experience and maturity with Backstage to the platform.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="whats-in-the-bundle-subscription">What‚Äôs in the bundle subscription?<a href="#whats-in-the-bundle-subscription" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What‚Äôs in the bundle subscription?" title="Direct link to What‚Äôs in the bundle subscription?">‚Äã</a></h4><p>We‚Äôre launching with a set of plugins that address different aspects of developer experience and engineering culture. We developed this bundle with feedback from a core group of customers ‚Äî and now that these versions of the plugins have been road-tested, we‚Äôll offer beta versions to all our Backstage adopters soon (<a href="http://backstage.spotify.com/event" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">very soon!</a>). Alongside the plugins themselves, customers can expect support and services to help them get up and running when they buy the bundle.</p><p>Spotify Plugins for Backstage leverage key features of the Backstage platform: its role as a central hub for all your engineering teams where they do their everyday work, creating data-driven feedback loops between your platform teams and your feature teams to continuously strengthen and improve your internal developer community, and of course, the streamlined UX that reduces complexity and makes it so easy to use.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="meet-the-plugins">Meet the plugins<a href="#meet-the-plugins" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Meet the plugins" title="Direct link to Meet the plugins">‚Äã</a></h4><p>Spotify Plugins for Backstage are aimed at solving common development challenges, reducing operational toil, encouraging best practices, and improving collaboration, transparency, and learning throughout your engineering org ‚Äî you know, all those things that pave the way for happier developers and happier code. Here are the plugins that will be available in the bundle.</p><p><strong>Soundcheck:</strong> See how well your components measure up to engineering best practices and standards at a glance. When owners can easily see the tech health of their components, it incentivizes quality, reliability, and alignment throughout your software ecosystem. The Soundcheck plugin visualizes checks for security, testing, reliability, and other development and operational standards. And seeing leads to doing. So instead of asking your developers to file and respond to yet another ticket, promote software quality through clear scorecards, actionable feedback, and positive reinforcement.</p><p><strong>RBAC:</strong> Manage access and protect your data in Backstage, flexibly and easily. Role-based access control (RBAC) should be as easy to manage as possible ‚Äî because the simpler it is to do, the better protected your data will be. Built on top of the open source permissions framework for Backstage, our RBAC plugin provides a no-code management UI for restricting access to plugins, routes, and data within your developer portal. With its intuitive interface, admins can quickly define roles, assign users and groups, and configure permissions to encode authorization decisions according to your organization‚Äôs evolving security and compliance needs.</p><p><strong>Skill Exchange:</strong> Share expertise across your org by creating an internal marketplace for on-the-job learning opportunities and promoting a culture of self-led growth. Talent, knowledge, and experience can often get trapped inside organizational silos. With the Skill Exchange plugin, now your R&amp;D community can unlock opportunities for collaboration and meaningful connection, no matter where anyone sits in the org chart. Mentors can connect with mentees, teams can connect with temporary help, developers can pair up to program together, and ad hoc teams can assemble to work on hack projects.</p><p>By making it easier for your developers to discover and borrow each other‚Äôs skills, both teams and individuals can learn, grow, and stretch their abilities together ‚Äî leading to happier, more fulfilled, and more capable devs ‚Äî&nbsp;no orientation required.</p><p><strong>Pulse:</strong> Find out how your R&amp;D teams really feel. Pulse is an R&amp;D survey framework that lets you track key productivity and satisfaction metrics, analyze the anonymized response data to discover trends, and visualize those insights (all within Backstage). Pulse focuses on the concerns of developers and other members of your tech community, telling you everything general HR surveys can‚Äôt ‚Äî from what your data scientists think about your workflow tooling to the most common blockers teams say they‚Äôre facing.</p><p>By helping you quantify developer satisfaction and effectiveness, the Pulse plugin allows you to collect the data you need to drive continuous improvements to your R&amp;D tooling, processes, and culture ‚Äî and ship code faster.</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong> Surveys are great for capturing how your people feel. But you also want to know how they‚Äôre actually behaving. The Insights plugin is your window into Backstage usage at your organization. It captures and displays key data points, including your daily active Backstage users and most commonly used plugins. With the Insights plugin, you can measure Backstage adoption, understand user behavior, and identify trends. Knowing how your teams are using Backstage today helps you meet the demands of tomorrow.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-is-spotify-selling-plugins">Why is Spotify selling plugins?<a href="#why-is-spotify-selling-plugins" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why is Spotify selling plugins?" title="Direct link to Why is Spotify selling plugins?">‚Äã</a></h3><p>We love a freemium business model here at Spotify. Our investment with Backstage is following suit with our consumer offerings ‚Äî in this case, the subscription is meant to enhance what‚Äôs available in open source. The overarching question we asked when developing these plugins was, ‚ÄúWill this make Backstage more useful and powerful for open source adopters?‚Äù And that‚Äôs the question we‚Äôll continue to ask as we evolve the subscription. </p><p>We hope that by adding paid plugins from Spotify to the other commercial services surrounding Backstage, the platform becomes more valuable to current adopters, we‚Äôll broaden its reach to new adopters, and we‚Äôll create a more diverse ecosystem for the community at large.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="sustaining-the-platform-and-the-community">Sustaining the platform and the community<a href="#sustaining-the-platform-and-the-community" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Sustaining the platform and the community" title="Direct link to Sustaining the platform and the community">‚Äã</a></h4><p>The bundle subscription is also how we see Spotify continuing to sustain its investment in Backstage. Revenue generated from the bundle can be reinvested into developing and releasing more plugins ‚Äî&nbsp;including more of the 200+ plugins we use internally ‚Äî and evolving Backstage further. We see this is a good thing for our community, for our teams, and our customers.</p><p>But to be clear: Spotify is not moving away from open source contributions or the Backstage project community. Instead, we‚Äôre doubling down on Backstage, and the bundle subscription enables Spotify to continue to grow our investment in the open source project and community.</p><p>A core part of our company mission is to unlock human potential and creativity. Developers are creators ‚Äî some of the most prolific creators given that every company is now a technology company. We believe they need a better experience to do their best work and that's what we‚Äôre aiming to provide with both Backstage and the Spotify Plugins bundle.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="when-will-the-bundle-subscription-be-available">When will the bundle subscription be available?<a href="#when-will-the-bundle-subscription-be-available" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to When will the bundle subscription be available?" title="Direct link to When will the bundle subscription be available?">‚Äã</a></h3><p>The bundle subscription is coming soon to a repo near you! We‚Äôre hosting a launch event on December 15 to share more. <a href="http://backstage.spotify.com/event" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Register here</a> to watch the event and learn more about the plugins and how to buy the bundle.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[Learn about how Backstage affects developer activity, development lifecycle, and developer retention at Spotify.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>All data analysis and research was conducted by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelbellato/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Michael Bellato</a>, Senior Data Scientist at Spotify.</em>
<em>Last updated: April 20, 2023</em></p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="headerimage" src="/assets/images/preview-46f97eb2b84b5bdd29c1286290879da5.png" width="2500" height="1313" class="img_ev3q"></p><p><strong>tl;dr</strong> We measured Backstage usage with developer activity, development lifecycle, and developer retention. Spoiler alert: It makes all three better!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-backstage-translates-to-quantifiable-impact">How Backstage translates to quantifiable impact<a href="#how-backstage-translates-to-quantifiable-impact" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How Backstage translates to quantifiable impact" title="Direct link to How Backstage translates to quantifiable impact">‚Äã</a></h2><p>At Spotify, we get a lot of questions around Backstage and the value it can give to organizations, and rightly so. We talk about how Backstage makes developers happier and more productive, but what does that actually mean in practice? A couple years ago, we <a href="https://backstage.spotify.com/blog/measuring-backstage-success-at-spotify/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">published a blog</a> detailing how we measure Backstage success at Spotify. This blog highlighted proxy metrics to gauge things we care about moving the needle on like time-to-tenth-PR, number of plugins contributed, satisfaction rates, etc.</p><p>But this time around, we wanted to share metrics that we believe affect a business‚Äô bottom line through a clear return on investment: developer activity, development lifecycle, and developer retention. And we found some pretty cool stuff‚Ä¶</p><p>At Spotify, we see frequent Backstage users:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="roidata" src="/assets/images/roidata-ee9fddddfa6162b54047645147aecef0.png" width="1667" height="523" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>That‚Äôs a lot! So let‚Äôs unpack all of these stats a bit.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="spotify-devs-do-better-with-backstage">Spotify devs do better with Backstage<a href="#spotify-devs-do-better-with-backstage" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Spotify devs do better with Backstage" title="Direct link to Spotify devs do better with Backstage">‚Äã</a></h2><p>Before we get too deep into the findings, let‚Äôs talk about  our methodology for this analysis. Michael Bellato, Senior Data Scientist at Spotify, observed Backstage activity for the first half of 2022 for developers. After observing that group, he measured developer activities, retention, and satisfaction for the same group for the next 6 months to a year. For simplicity, this pre-post approach in our analysis does not account for potential seasonality effects. As well, given the level of adoption for Backstage within Spotify with our internal developer community, there was no possibility to carry out our analysis by using a control group of non Backstage users. We therefore used observational methods to determine Backstage‚Äôs value and grouped users into 2 categories: frequent and less frequent users. In order to ensure both groups of users were as comparable as possible, we then controlled and matched factors such as their tenure (in number of weeks) and work mode (i.e. office or remote).</p><p>Now onto the findings! At Spotify, we believe that Backstage improves developer effectiveness, which is a function of satisfaction and productivity. So we set out to quantify what these terms mean in practice for us. For satisfaction, we felt that retention was a good indicator of how a developer‚Äôs happiness or satisfaction at a company affects the bottom line. For productivity, we looked at developer output and speed. Lastly, we found what Backstage means for the longevity of a developer‚Äôs output. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="productivity">Productivity<a href="#productivity" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Productivity" title="Direct link to Productivity">‚Äã</a></h3><p>There are so many ways to quantify productivity. Through user research we have discovered that Backstage increases productivity through the ability to find, understand, and take action on information; in general, organizations find they are able to do more with less. With consideration to these findings, we have focused this research on productivity as developer output and speed.</p><p>First, we found that developers that use Backstage more often have 2.3x more developer activity in GitHub in the following six months than the bottom Backstage users. From our internal developer survey that we send out every quarter we also noticed that developers that are more active have higher ratings of their perceived productivity (Psst! If you‚Äôre interested in setting up your own survey in Backstage, check out <a href="https://backstage.spotify.com/plugins/pulse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pulse</a>).</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="graph showing more github activity for frequent backstage users" src="/assets/images/graph1-a02e02eee4c009e3d7b97e47e765c5c1.png" width="1000" height="800" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>We also saw that frequent Backstage users create over 2x more code changes than infrequent Backstage users. On top of that, these code changes take 17% less cycle time for more frequent Backstage users.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="graph showing more code changes for people that use backstage frequently" src="/assets/images/graph2-fcb0296b687164fd60dfd34b578151ac.png" width="1000" height="800" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>When we combined the reduced cycle time with increased PR activity, we found that this had an effect of saving 3 full time employees (FTEs) for a team of 10 developers.  Developers that are more productive in less time, save time and resources for an engineering organization.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="development-lifecycle-and-speed">Development lifecycle and speed<a href="#development-lifecycle-and-speed" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Development lifecycle and speed" title="Direct link to Development lifecycle and speed">‚Äã</a></h3><p>But what does speed matter if you‚Äôre not able to ensure improvements in the overall development lifecycle? When your developers deploy new software, you want to ensure it meets standards and you don‚Äôt have to change or deprecate it in short order. From user research we found that Backstage‚Äôs flexibility enables organizations to address a wide range of needs in a wide range of contexts, thus adding efficiencies to existing capabilities. These efficiencies are what we have been able to confirm at Spotify with the adoption of Backstage throughout the different stages of the development lifecycle; evidenced with the productivity improvements measured in our most recent analysis. At Spotify, we found that high frequency Backstage users deploy software to production 2x as often and their software stays deployed 3x as long. We believe that higher rates of deployments to production and their increased longevity are indications of higher code quality, as well as increased developer speed and productivity.
<img loading="lazy" alt="graph showing more code changes for longer" src="/assets/images/graph3-9db08a0b6337babfec4db2ccc613e0a7.png" width="1000" height="800" class="img_ev3q"></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="satisfaction">Satisfaction<a href="#satisfaction" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Satisfaction" title="Direct link to Satisfaction">‚Äã</a></h3><p>In our analysis, we found that employees that use Backstage more frequently are 5% more likely to be at Spotify 12 months later.

            <description><![CDATA[Spotify‚Äôs Pia Nilsson digs into the ins and outs of developer effectiveness on the Thoughtworks tech podcast.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Note: This post was originally published on the <a href="https://engineering.atspotify.com/2021/09/23/how-backstage-made-our-developers-more-effective-and-how-it-can-help-yours-too/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spotify Engineering blog</a>.</em></p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="How Backstage made our developers more effective ‚Äî and how it can help yours, too" src="/assets/images/spotify-devs-create-manage-explore-0ce75f59fd806f3f10aa97f9f4ef18aa.png" width="960" height="504" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>What‚Äôs the best way to assess your developers‚Äô experience and performance to discover what they need help with? Is it by measuring something arbitrary, like how many lines of code they‚Äôve written or how many commits they‚Äôve made? Nope. How much useful data are you really getting out of those numbers anyway?</p><p>Instead, it‚Äôs more helpful to think of performance in terms of ‚Äúdeveloper effectiveness‚Äù. Suddenly, it‚Äôs not about the quantity of work and time spent, but the quality. Are engineers wasting a bunch of their days just trying to find what they need to get started, or are they able to jump straight into the work they really want to do with as few blockers as possible?</p><p>Pia Nilsson, Director of Engineering and Head of Platform Developer Experience at Spotify, addressed these and other questions on the <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/podcasts/technology-podcasts/developer-effectiveness" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thoughtworks podcast</a>: What types of problems do Spotify engineers face? And why did we create <a href="https://backstage.spotify.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Backstage</a> to address those issues? Read on to find out how exactly Backstage helped us, and how you can use Backstage to boost the effectiveness of your own team.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="growing-pains">Growing pains<a href="#growing-pains" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Growing pains" title="Direct link to Growing pains">‚Äã</a></h2><p>As Pia explains in the podcast, when she started at Spotify in 2016, we were facing an interesting problem. We were in the middle of a hiring boom during a period of exponential growth. From the outside, everything seemed to be moving along swimmingly. But internally, a few metrics were giving us pause; specifically, our productivity wasn‚Äôt increasing at all, even with all the new hires.</p><p>So we did what we always do: we looked at the data. We had a few metrics for determining and monitoring developer effectiveness ‚Äî deployment frequency, for instance ‚Äî but the most crucial was our onboarding metric. You see, we gauge how well our onboarding process is working by measuring how long it takes for a new engineer to make their tenth pull request. And in the midst of our hiring frenzy, that number was getting incredibly high: over 60 days. Clearly something had to be done, but what were the issues developers were facing to begin with?</p><p>Pia and her team looked into the issue, and this was the feedback she got back from the engineers, in her own words:</p><ol><li><p>‚ÄúFirst, it was the context switching ‚Ä¶ because we had a very fragmented ecosystem. Why did we have a fragmented ecosystem? ‚Ä¶ Every single team is like a little startup, and it‚Äôs free to charge ahead and reach their mission by themselves ‚Ä¶ This is very conducive for speed, but when we grow, that‚Äôs where stuff starts to break down. Of course, this leads to a lot of cognitive load for our engineers.‚Äù</p></li><li><p>‚ÄúThe number two blocker was that it‚Äôs just hard to find things. Which service should I be integrating with as an engineer? Should I use the user data service that the customer service team has built? Or should I use the slightly different user data service that the premium team has built? Or should I just go ahead and build my own? This, of course, leads to further fragmentation, and we‚Äôre back to problem number one.‚Äù</p></li></ol><p>Considering both of these challenges, it‚Äôs clear that as Spotify grew, our famously autonomous culture was also driving our working environment to become increasingly convoluted and disparate. No one was on the same page, and it was starting to weigh us down. The obvious solution, of course, would be to mandate our engineers use the same technologies and microservices so that we started acting more as a monolith.</p><p>But that just wouldn‚Äôt fly at Spotify. Again, our autonomous culture, and all the freedom that comes with it, was a big reason a lot of people liked working at Spotify to begin with. It‚Äôs key to our identity. Mandating our problems away was out of the question.</p><p>What else could we do? What we needed was a solution that prioritized developers and their ways of working. What we needed was a place where everyone could go to find everything they needed, no matter what it was. What we needed was Backstage.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="backstage-a-platform-for-your-platforms">Backstage: a platform for your platforms<a href="#backstage-a-platform-for-your-platforms" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Backstage: a platform for your platforms" title="Direct link to Backstage: a platform for your platforms">‚Äã</a></h2><p>As Pia notes, Spotify developed <a href="https://engineering.atspotify.com/2020/03/17/what-the-heck-is-backstage-anyway/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Backstage</a> to help our engineers do three different things: find stuff, manage stuff, and create stuff. In other words, it‚Äôs built to address all the blockers our engineers were facing, especially in terms of discoverability.</p><p>Where our engineers used to spend hours of their week just looking for things ‚Äî documentation, platforms, systems and their owners ‚Äî all over the internet, now they can find everything in one place: Backstage. Similarly, rather than moving from tab to tab, checking to see the health of, say, their Kubernetes clusters or the status of their recent deployment, engineers can now use Backstage to bring together monitoring tools, logging, their CI/CD pipeline, and whatever else our engineers needed to manage.</p><p>Now, let‚Äôs say our engineers want to spin up a new ML model, data pipeline, or some other component or microservice. Rather than building something on their own, introducing yet another instance of boilerplate code similar to a dozen others in our ecosystem, they can now use Backstage to do that work for them. Not only does this save them time if they choose to do this, but these new components and services are also set up using our own best practices and tech standards ‚Äî what we call our <a href="https://engineering.atspotify.com/2020/08/17/how-we-use-golden-paths-to-solve-fragmentation-in-our-software-ecosystem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Golden Paths</a>.</p><p>Because of this, we‚Äôre able to have our cake and eat it too. Our engineers and squads can remain entirely autonomous, even as Backstage nudges them toward walking down these Golden Paths, thereby increasing our teams‚Äô alignment and keeping our ecosystem from becoming more fragmented. Additionally, because <a href="https://github.com/backstage/backstage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Backstage is a rapidly growing open source tool</a>, more and more features and plugins are constantly being added for a variety of use cases beyond the ones mentioned here.</p><p>So, with all that being said, was Backstage worth all the time and money we invested into it? Well, let‚Äôs go back to the onboarding metrics one more time. Remember when Pia discovered that it took over 60 days for onboarding engineers to merge their tenth pull request? After Backstage was introduced, that number dropped to only 20. ‚ÄúAnd if you have numbers like that in your organization,‚Äù mentions Pia, ‚ÄúI find that it‚Äôs easy to get buy-in for investments in developer experience.‚Äù</p><p>Interested in hearing more about Backstage and what it can do for you?

At this point, we‚Äôve spoken with hundreds of companies at various stages in their Backstage journey. Those conversations run the gamut but most often the question we hear is, <a href="https://backstage.io/blog/2021/05/20/adopting-backstage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">‚ÄúHow do I get started with Backstage?‚Äù</a></p><p>If you‚Äôve been asking yourself the same thing, the good news is: you‚Äôre not the first and you‚Äôre not alone. Backstage is still new, but we‚Äôve now crossed over 18 months with the project in the wild. And we‚Äôve learned a ton: how unique each organization‚Äôs needs are, when flexibility and customization can lead to paralysis, and where teams have found quick wins in building better developer experience.</p><p>So if you‚Äôre curious about how to get started with Backstage, <a href="https://info.backstage.spotify.com/office-hours" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">give us a shout</a> and book a one-to-one meeting. Given our 5+ years of experience as the original adopter, the Spotify team brings a lot of lessons learned and perspective on how to position the investment needed to bring a developer portal to life.</p><p>We‚Äôre also happy to connect you with <a href="https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/ADOPTERS.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">other adopters</a> in the community.

One important change includes stabilizing core APIs in the scaffolder and catalog plugins. Most of these changes will be in the underlying typescript APIs.</p></li><li><p><strong>More on Homepage Templates!</strong>: We launched Homepage templates on January 25, which allows you to customize your Backstage homepage! In this Community Session, we follow up to <a href="https://backstage.io/blog/2022/01/25/backstage-homepage-templates" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this blog post on Homepage templates</a> with a demo and roadmap ideas for the new feature. Spotify‚Äôs Himanshu Mishra takes us through a demo on how to get started with Homepage Templates followed by Emma Indal reviewing components and reveals that we are designing two more Homepage Templates. Check out <a href="https://backstage.io/docs/getting-started/homepage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this Getting Started tutorial</a> for step-by-step instructions on updating your homepage.</p></li><li><p><strong>Discover useful info with Catalog entity insights</strong>: Spotify‚Äôs Fredrik Adel√∂w shows us how to unearth useful information about any catalog entity. By clicking the three dots menu in the upper right hand corner of your entity views in Backstage, you can find information like raw yaml, uid, ancestry data, and other metadata for your entities. This new tool provides deeper, technical information for those that want it.</p></li><li><p><strong>Q&amp;A</strong>: Any ideas on how to move existing knowledge bases to TechDocs? What do different organizations' engineering teams look like for supporting Backstage?</p></li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="watch-the-contributors-session">Watch the contributors session<a href="#watch-the-contributors-session" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Watch the contributors session" title="Direct link to Watch the contributors session">‚Äã</a></h2><youtube url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Buu_KWdIFwU" title="Backstage Community Session 13 ‚Äî Adopters: February 16, 2022"></youtube><p>Highlights from this Contributors Session include:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Vote for Contributor Spotlight</strong>: Like we said before, we love our community and we want to highlight and appreciate all the invaluable work our contributors add to Backstage.

But as you‚Äôll see in the <a href="https://backstage.io/docs/overview/roadmap" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Q1 product roadmap</a>, even bigger milestones are just around the corner. Francesco Corti shared a first-look at the roadmap, which includes such big deals as:</p><ul><li>The impending release of Backstage 1.0 (and what that means)</li><li>Initiating third-party security audits</li><li>Becoming an incubating project with the CNCF</li></ul><p>Watch the video below to see into the very near future of Backstage, and share your feedback on the roadmap.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="watch-the-adopters-session">Watch the adopters session<a href="#watch-the-adopters-session" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Watch the adopters session" title="Direct link to Watch the adopters session">‚Äã</a></h2><youtube url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/z2aeRlNOTLk" title="Backstage Community Session 12 ‚Äî Adopters: January 19, 2022"></youtube><p>Along with an overview of the roadmap, other highlights from the session include:</p><ul><li><strong>Kiratech demos Krateo PlatformOps:</strong> The ‚Äúsecond wave of cloud native adoption‚Äù has arrived ‚Äî and the digital transformation experts at Kiratech are easing the way for enterprise companies. Their open source tool Krateo acts as a single control pane for any resource, whether it‚Äôs a K8s cluster, microservice, application, pipeline, database, or anything else. Diego Braga shows how Krateo uses Backstage, Kubernetes, and Crossplane to make it easy for anyone to harness the power of the CNCF landscape. If a YAML file can reference it, then Krateo can manage it. <a href="https://github.com/krateoplatformops/krateo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Give Krateo a try yourself</a>.</li><li><strong>Adding more clouds to Cost Insights:</strong> Spotify‚Äôs Tim Hansen takes us on a tour of the Cost Insights plugin ‚Äî the Backstage plugin that helped Spotify save millions of dollars in cloud costs in a matter of months. (Wait, what? <a href="https://backstage.io/blog/2020/10/22/cost-insights-plugin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yep</a>.)

But what does 1.0 really mean? Or 1.0.1? The maintainers have thought long and hard about the release process for the future versions of Backstage (both the app and the individual plugin packages), so that you know what to expect going from x.1.x to x.2.x ‚Äî and everything in-between.

Task workers are handy, and in some cases essential, when you‚Äôre a Backstage service provider, like Roadie, working with customers who need to restrict how the network, load balancers, and other internal resources are shared. Using Roadie‚Äôs task workers implementation, scaffolder tasks are run, scheduled, and stored in a constrained environment, making deployment tasks safer and easier.</p></li><li><p><strong>Q&amp;A with the maintainers:</strong> When is Backstage 1.0 coming and more on the Q1 2022 product roadmap.</p></li></ul><p><a href="https://github.com/backstage/community" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Subscribe to the Community Session calendar</a> ‚Üí</p>]]></content:encoded>

Unsurprisingly, the highly valued fintech company has been growing fast. They first started thinking about a developer portal when their team was fewer than 100 people. But their headcount kept doubling, and before they knew it, the team had grown to 500 engineers, project managers, and designers, all in a span of a few months. Tooling was growing along with the number of people, and it was becoming difficult for anyone to figure out how things were done. Enter Backstage.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Slide 1: Brex is growing‚Ä¶ Number of workloads, Number of teams, Number of tools.

After the Box team incorporated their existing service catalog and grabbed a few open source plugins from the <a href="https://backstage.io/plugins/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Plugin Marketplace</a>, their Backstage MVP was off to a solid start.</p><p>Next, the team used Backstage Software Templates (aka the Scaffolder) to make it easier for their engineers to create new services: just click through a few form fields, and a ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù skeleton project is automatically set up in a new repo with the first build already running.

As a software development team at TELUS, we support that mission by building hundreds of apps and services for our customers, partners and fellow team members which can mean a lot of change. Change is good and can be exciting, but personally, I think boring is better. </p><p>As an early adopter, we‚Äôve learned a lot and wanted to share our story alongside some important lessons we think other adopters can benefit from as they begin their Backstage journey. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="breaking-down-monoliths">Breaking down monoliths<a href="#breaking-down-monoliths" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Breaking down monoliths" title="Direct link to Breaking down monoliths">‚Äã</a></h2><p>Not only has our team of over 2,500 developers grown quickly over the past few years, we‚Äôve also been actively breaking down multiple software monoliths. As our team grew bigger, centralized locations for tools, information, and best practices quickly fell apart and became siloed. A few years ago, we found that our developer platform ‚Äî originally built as a shadow IT project ‚Äî had hit its ceiling. The world had shifted in terms of developer experience best practices and we needed something new. </p><p>Our goal was to create a common touchpoint where we could evangelize better defaults so people chose our platform over one-off, siloed solutions. We wanted to enable faster builds at lower cost and create sustainable software groups through a single pane of glass that surfaced our ‚Äúclass A‚Äù tools: something deeply standardized (aka boring) to help everyone do their best work more efficiently lower in the stack, and freeing them up to be more interesting and innovative where it counts.</p><p>With all this in mind, we started to build our own developer portal because we couldn‚Äôt find anything that would do the job. Until we came across Backstage. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="from-backstage-to-simplify">From Backstage to Simplify<a href="#from-backstage-to-simplify" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to From Backstage to Simplify" title="Direct link to From Backstage to Simplify">‚Äã</a></h2><p>With our partner, <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thoughtworks</a>, we started exploring Backstage early in 2021. After thorough evaluation, we decided to move forward with Backstage even though the project was in the early stages. It was clear what Spotify had built felt like a true values alignment with TELUS and our vision of democratizing development. </p><p>We also really liked that Backstage was an open source project where we could pull in innovation from a growing community and contribute back in kind. It was way more appealing than paying for an off-the-shelf SaaS tool that we‚Äôd have to end up heavily customizing anyway. Adopting Backstage has been a big turning point for our open source efforts more broadly at TELUS and we‚Äôre now building an open source software contribution and consumption policy. </p><p>We opted to call our developer portal ‚ÄúSimplify‚Äù because that‚Äôs exactly what it needed to do for our developers. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="lessons-from-a-very-early-adopter">Lessons from a (very) early adopter<a href="#lessons-from-a-very-early-adopter" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Lessons from a (very) early adopter" title="Direct link to Lessons from a (very) early adopter">‚Äã</a></h2><p>We‚Äôve learned a lot along the way as we‚Äôve built out our first use case and put together the broader roadmap for Simplify. </p><ul><li><p><strong>Start narrow:</strong> You could say we took a slight deviation from the well-traveled starting point of ingesting all our components into the Software Catalog. One of our core problems was that,  in order to scale asynchronously, documentation had to be a core citizen in software. We had 80+ microsites of various quality housing technical documentations and it was very difficult to find things. Our primary audience was new joiners with metrics around making onboarding as self-serve as possible. Though we had to veer away from the TechDocs feature to get there, we‚Äôve seen big improvements in the time-to-10th commit metric in particular. </p></li><li><p><strong>Keep your brand in mind:</strong> We struggled in that some of the design composability needs we had weren‚Äôt well-built in open source yet. TELUS has a very strong brand and to get Simplify on-brand, we had to contort the Backstage UI to meet our brand standards. Generally, we believe branding your Backstage app is an adoption best practice and recommend bringing product design resources in from the beginning to ensure you‚Äôre creating something that will build a sense of internal ownership and enthusiasm in your org. </p></li><li><p><strong>Don‚Äôt be afraid of plugins:</strong> Perhaps because we started working with Backstage <em>so early</em>, we ended up building out some custom features that ‚Äî as of the 1.0 version ‚Äî are no longer needed. In early 2022, we actually hit the reset button and rebuilt our implementation from the ground up to take better advantage of the current options including many plugins that didn‚Äôt exist when we started. What has been incredible is that we were able to do this reset very quickly, without losing any of the fantastic documentation we had. We are now better positioned to incorporate new plugins and even more easily contribute our plugins back to the community.</p></li></ul><p>There‚Äôs still a lot of work ahead for Simplify and we‚Äôre excited to share upcoming milestones and wins with the Backstage community.</p>]]></content:encoded>

More than 90 people joined the event to talk about all things Backstage and we wanted to share our notes in case you missed it. üììüìùüìé</p><p>Eight topics were discussed over the course of the two-hour event with each topic proposed and selected by event attendees. The selected topics were:</p><ul><li>How to keep Backstage up-to-date</li><li>How to use Backstage to catalog monolithic services</li><li>How to use the Homepage plugin and what to use it for</li><li>How to grow TechDocs adoption</li><li>How to model systems and domains in Backstage</li><li>How to let multiple teams contribute functionality to Backstage</li><li>How to do ingestion integration testing with Backstage (live demo!)</li><li>How to convince your InfoSec team that it is safe to connect Backstage to internal systems.</li></ul><p>Once the top topics were upvoted, we divided into smaller discussion groups where we could dig in on each one.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Backstage Unconference March 3" src="/assets/images/unconference-tracks-0bd8a3ca4f19b802a777cbd576c20e41.png" width="2000" height="683" class="img_ev3q"></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="takeaways"><strong>Takeaways</strong><a href="#takeaways" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to takeaways" title="Direct link to takeaways">‚Äã</a></h3><p>The <a href="https://roadie.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Roadie</a> team was on hand throughout to note significant takeaways or discussion points. Below are some of the key things we picked out.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="using-the-homepage-plugin"><strong>Using the Homepage plugin</strong><a href="#using-the-homepage-plugin" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to using-the-homepage-plugin" title="Direct link to using-the-homepage-plugin">‚Äã</a></h4><ul><li>The cards people are using on the homepage include items for:<ul><li>Recently visited entities</li><li>Favorite entities</li><li>A ‚ÄúGetting Started guide‚Äù for a first time Backstage user</li><li>A company news feed</li></ul></li><li>There is ongoing discussion about how to customize the homepage. For example, should each end user have power over their own homepage layout or should it be set the same for every user?</li><li>Some teams are organizing their homepage around the question ‚ÄúWhat should I work on today?‚Äù while others are targeting ‚ÄúI‚Äôm new here‚Ä¶how do I get to X?‚Äù</li></ul><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="modeling-systems-and-domains"><strong>Modeling systems and domains</strong><a href="#modeling-systems-and-domains" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to modeling-systems-and-domains" title="Direct link to modeling-systems-and-domains">‚Äã</a></h4><ul><li>There was a general question around how to use domains as a concept</li><li>Systems are composable so they offer more flexibility. Domains are more uncertain. For example, there is confusion around whether they should be ‚Äúvertical‚Äù based on a particular product that the company offers or ‚Äúhorizontal‚Äù based on a role that might exist in multiple teams.</li><li>People wondered if domains within domains could make sense.</li><li>People would love if dependencies between components could be worked out automatically</li><li>There was an idea to use dependencies as an information feed for Tech Insights. For example, if you know that Service A depends on Service B, and service B has a problem, we could theoretically use Tech Insights to highlight that Service A has a problematic dependency.</li></ul><p>In order to try and address some of the questions raised, we've published a guide to <a href="https://roadie.io/blog/modelling-software-backstage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">modeling systems in Backstage</a>.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="adopting-techdocs"><strong>Adopting TechDocs</strong><a href="#adopting-techdocs" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to adopting-techdocs" title="Direct link to adopting-techdocs">‚Äã</a></h4><ul><li>For some companies, the biggest friction point for TechDocs is getting everyone to add the techdocs-cli build step to their pipeline. For others, this is a non-issue since they have injection points in every CI where they can add functionality.</li><li>Exporting to markdown from Confluence doesn‚Äôt really work. They have too much custom markup and too many widgets. Exporting from Notion works better since it exports clean markdown.</li></ul><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="convincing-your-infosec-team"><strong>Convincing your InfoSec team</strong><a href="#convincing-your-infosec-team" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to convincing-your-infosec-team" title="Direct link to convincing-your-infosec-team">‚Äã</a></h4><ul><li>Putting Backstage behind the VPN is an obvious security choice, but it introduces friction for people who are trying to use Backstage and some orgs don‚Äôt want to do it for that reason.</li><li>For Backstage to be successful, you need large scale adoption so friction minimization should be prioritized.</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="thank-you"><strong>Thank you!</strong><a href="#thank-you" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to thank-you" title="Direct link to thank-you">‚Äã</a></h3><p>The organizers wish to say thank you to everyone who attended and helped to make this event special. An Unconference is only as good as the community serves, and the Backstage community has shown itself to be an enthusiastic and welcoming space once again.</p><p>Thank you to the Backstage team at Spotify for announcing the event in the official Backstage community newsletter.</p><p>Lastly, thank you to <a href="https://github.com/martina-if" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Martina</a> from Roadie and <a href="https://github.com/jorgelainfiesta" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jorge</a> from <a href="https://frontside.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Frontside</a> for organizing and hosting the event.

            <description><![CDATA[Happy second birthday Backstage! Read this post to learn more about how we have grown as a project and community.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Note: This post was originally published on <a href="https://backstage.io/blog/2022/03/16/backstage-turns-two" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Backstage.io</a>.</em></p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="A cake celebrating Backstage‚Äôs second birthday" src="/assets/images/backstage-2nd-birthday-7da17e155e85f480531f780a560238d2.gif" width="1200" height="630" class="img_ev3q"></p><p><strong>TLDR:</strong> Backstage has turned two. Of course, this is software, so we expect things to move fast. But when you have a passionate, worldwide community building together, we‚Äôve now seen firsthand just how fast that can be. We‚Äôre marking our second year as a community by becoming a CNCF incubating project, reaching 100 public adopters, releasing version 1.0 of the core app, and other very nice birthday gifts. Rather than a toddler finding their feet, Backstage today is beginning to look awfully grown-up for a two-year-old.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="out-of-the-sandbox-and-into-incubation">Out of the Sandbox and into Incubation<a href="#out-of-the-sandbox-and-into-incubation" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Out of the Sandbox and into Incubation" title="Direct link to Out of the Sandbox and into Incubation">‚Äã</a></h2><p>Two years ago, a small team at Spotify launched Backstage into open source during our internal Hack Week. We knew we had something special on our hands and that Backstage could potentially be the most ambitious open source project in Spotify‚Äôs history (you can listen to me wax philosophical on this topic more in <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/332yTwGiILGKTS7dsHCj2P?si=pX9xTzB2SgmsROdlLLr24A" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Episode 2 of the new NerdOut@Spotify podcast</a>.)</p><p>When Spotify donated the project to the CNCF, we saw it as the first promising step toward making Backstage an industry standard. As the home to Kubernetes, Envoy, and so many other game-changing open technologies, the CNCF and its community has had a wide-ranging impact on the daily lives of developers everywhere. And that‚Äôs what we hoped for Backstage, even back then.</p><p>But we couldn't have envisioned where we‚Äôd be two years later ‚Äî part of an ever-growing community of people that feel as passionate as we do about unlocking better developer experience for every engineering organization.</p><p>Yesterday, the CNCF announced that its <a href="https://github.com/cncf/toc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Technical Oversight Committee</a> (TOC) voted to accept Backstage as a <a href="https://www.cncf.io/blog/2022/03/15/backstage-project-joins-the-cncf-incubator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CNCF incubating project</a>. The move from the CNCF Sandbox to Incubation is an important step forward for the project‚Äôs technical governance.</p><p>It‚Äôs also recognition for all the work the Backstage open source community has done to advance and grow this project since we launched the repo on GitHub just a few weeks after that Hack Week. We still have a long way to go to becoming the standard, but moving out of the CNCF Sandbox and beginning the Incubation phase is further validation of those aspirations.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-do-retailers-gaming-studios-banks-airlines-streamers-startups-and-enterprise-software-makers-all-have-in-common">What do retailers, gaming studios, banks, airlines, streamers, startups, and enterprise software makers all have in common?<a href="#what-do-retailers-gaming-studios-banks-airlines-streamers-startups-and-enterprise-software-makers-all-have-in-common" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What do retailers, gaming studios, banks, airlines, streamers, startups, and enterprise software makers all have in common?" title="Direct link to What do retailers, gaming studios, banks, airlines, streamers, startups, and enterprise software makers all have in common?">‚Äã</a></h2><p>Developers, developers, developers ‚Äî that‚Äôs what all companies have in common. Developers dealing with <a href="https://youtu.be/85TQEpNCaU0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more complexity</a> than they‚Äôve ever had to deal with before. Developers who want to be able to go from idea to bug fix or feature faster.</p><p>Two years in, the Backstage ecosystem has grown by leaps and bounds. More than 5,000 contributors have joined the project and are submitting bugs, adding new features, and building valuable plugins that benefit the greater community. From <a href="https://backstage.spotify.com/blog/measuring-backstage-proof-of-value-at-expedia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Expedia Group</a> (adopter No.18) to Unity (adopter No.67), Backstage now has <a href="https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/ADOPTERS.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">100 publicly listed adopters</a> across a variety of industries, including retail, gaming, financial services, manufacturing, and government.</p><p>We have companies like <a href="http://roadie.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Roadie</a> providing hosting solutions and ThoughtWorks <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/en-us/about-us/news/2021/thoughtworks-is-collaborating-with-spotify-to-deliver-better-dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">providing technology and consulting services</a> to teams looking to stand up Backstage in their own orgs. We‚Äôre starting to see more and more job listings for Backstage developers which tells us that companies of all shapes and sizes are going all-in on Backstage and developer effectiveness.</p><p>Also, I‚Äôll pause now to give a special shoutout to our early adopters. They stuck with us through all the bumps and breaking changes. But because of their early commitment, we now see instances of Backstage up and running in so many different kinds of engineering organizations. From <a href="https://youtu.be/6sg5uMCLxTA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zalando</a> to <a href="https://backstage.spotify.com/blog/adopter-spotlight/american-airlines-runway/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">American Airlines</a> and <a href="https://backstage.spotify.com/blog/community-session/11-brex-backstage-upgrade-helper/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brex</a>, the growing pains of our earliest adopters helped pave the way for smoother adoptions for all who follow them.</p><p>A few more numbers that make us proud:</p><ul><li>2,000+ project forks</li><li>20,000+ commits</li><li>10,000+ PRs &amp; issues</li><li>15,000+ stars on GitHub</li><li>60+ open source plugins in the <a href="https://backstage.io/plugins" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Backstage Plugin Marketplace</a></li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="a-global-community-of-friendly-helpful-contributors">A global community of friendly, helpful contributors<a href="#a-global-community-of-friendly-helpful-contributors" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to A global community of friendly, helpful contributors" title="Direct link to A global community of friendly, helpful contributors">‚Äã</a></h2><p>We open sourced Backstage in March 2020 and then almost immediately went into lockdown. When you think about this project in the context of the pandemic, it's really remarkable how much this community has been able to achieve.</p><p>The Backstage community is truly global with adopters and contributors from almost every continent (sorry, Antarctica!) coming together to share what they‚Äôve worked on and demo cool stuff in our monthly Community Sessions. The repo and the Discord server truly never sleep as a growing group of dedicated Backstage experts outside Spotify support one another and offer help 24/7.</p><p>We asked a few contributors and maintainers to share their thoughts around this two-year milestone.</p><youtube title="Backstage Turns Two!" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-j-waaybcH0"></youtube><p>Warms the heart, doesn‚Äôt it? Thanks again to all our contributors for making this possible. Seriously. We‚Äôre proud of what the community has accomplished and how we‚Äôve accomplished it. All along, it‚Äôs your enthusiasm and warm/collaborative/positive vibes that have carried us and this project through.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="version-10-and-beyond">Version 1.0 and beyond<a href="#version-10-and-beyond" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Version 1.0 and beyond" title="Direct link to Version 1.0 and beyond">‚Äã</a></h2><p>Tomorrow, we‚Äôll be releasing version 1.0 of the Backstage core framework, including Software Catalog, Software Templates, TechDocs, and API Reference. With Backstage 1.0, the project‚Äôs core components are coming out of beta and into production with regular versioning and release cycle commitments (check back on this blog for more details!).</p><p>v1.0 paves the way for more adoption, a bigger community, more contributions ‚Äî and with this continued growth in the ecosystem, we expect even greater innovation on the platform just on the horizon with exchange of features and plugins.</p><p>What comes next for Backstage is ‚Äî in many ways ‚Äî entirely up to you. We are looking to this community to <a href="https://backstage.io/docs/overview/roadmap" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">help us shape the next year</a>.</p><p>If you‚Äôre already a part of this community, thank you for your hard work and dedication. Backstage wouldn‚Äôt be where it is today without you. We‚Äôve come a long way together, but there‚Äôs still so much to do.</p><p>And if you haven‚Äôt signed up yet, there‚Äôs plenty of room on this party boat! And there‚Äôs never been a better time to hop on board. As Irma (<a href="https://github.com/Irma12" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Irma12</a>) said so beautifully: where else is there an opportunity to have so many people look at your code, hear you out, and help you out?</p><p>Take a look at how to <a href="https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">start contributing</a> and <a href="https://github.com/backstage/community" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">join the community</a>!</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[Backstage‚Äôs security posture continues to mature with its latest security improvements and new threat model.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Note: This post was originally published on <a href="https://backstage.io/blog/2022/08/23/backstage-security-audit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Backstage.io</a>.</em></p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Security Audit Image" src="/assets/images/preview-d0283e8fb2fc980642fd9b4be7057cf5.png" width="1200" height="630" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>TL;DR: Backstage‚Äôs security posture continues to mature! Today, we‚Äôre releasing a report from an independent security audit and the first version of the Backstage Threat Model.</p><p>As an <a href="https://www.cncf.io/blog/2022/03/15/backstage-project-joins-the-cncf-incubator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Incubating project</a> within the <a href="https://www.cncf.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)</a>, Backstage was fortunate enough to take advantage of a sponsored security audit. The <a href="https://ostif.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Open Source Technology Improvement Fund (OSTIF)</a> sponsored the audit as part of its ongoing efforts to secure the open source software ecosystem, and the audit itself was performed by <a href="https://x41-dsec.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X41 D-Sec</a>. Our goal with the audit was to evaluate and improve Backstage‚Äôs security posture, focusing on the core Backstage framework and plugins.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="report-findings-and-fixes">Report Findings and Fixes<a href="#report-findings-and-fixes" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Report Findings and Fixes" title="Direct link to Report Findings and Fixes">‚Äã</a></h2><p>The security audit and improvements concluded earlier this month, on August 18th.  The audit <strong>findings</strong> totalled two critical, two high, five medium, and three low severity vulnerabilities, alongside 15 side findings with no direct security impact. As of the <a href="https://backstage.io/docs/releases/v1.5.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Backstage 1.5 release</a>, eight out of the 12 main findings and many of the side findings are fully remedied. If you are a few versions behind there‚Äôs no need to worry though, most fixes were included in the 1.3 release.</p><p>Out of the four findings that have yet to be fixed, three are related to rate limiting or internal DoS concerns. With the introduction of the Backstage Threat Model (more on that below), Backstage‚Äôs positioning states that this is outside the scope of the security concerns of Backstage. Rather, we trust internal users of Backstage to not intentionally sabotage the availability of the service. This is not to say that we will never aim to get these findings addressed, but we have pushed them to be potential future improvements as we focus our near-term efforts on improving the product in other ways.</p><p>The last outstanding finding is to build out the capabilities of our service-to-service auth system. This is an area where the audit identified a couple of missing pieces in our early version of the implementation. We have since closed the gap by introducing token expiration, and will continue to work on this as we open up for more complex and hardened deployment patterns through the <a href="https://github.com/backstage/backstage/issues/11611" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">evolution of the backend system</a>.</p><p>Another important finding was the potential for confusion and user impersonation due to most authentication providers having sign-in enabled by default. This finding reinforced our decision to switch sign-in to being disabled by default for all authentication providers, which was part of the <a href="https://backstage.io/docs/releases/v1.1.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1.1 release</a>.</p><p>Perhaps the most important outcome of this audit is that it helped us focus our efforts to keep improving the security of Backstage. It identified priority areas in both implementation and documentation for us going forward. One particular area that was pointed out in a finding is the documentation around the security model of Backstage deployment. There have been several efforts to highlight this in documentation, but it is still not clear enough. What we‚Äôve been lacking is documentation that is completely dedicated towards detailing the security concerns of Backstage. That is why in addition to publishing the security audit report, we are also introducing the <a href="https://backstage.io/docs/overview/threat-model" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Backstage Threat Model</a>.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="introducing-the-backstage-threat-model">Introducing the Backstage Threat Model<a href="#introducing-the-backstage-threat-model" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Introducing the Backstage Threat Model" title="Direct link to Introducing the Backstage Threat Model">‚Äã</a></h2><p>The existing Backstage documentation has many security concerns interwoven within its text, but to find them all, you need to spend a lot of time reading. We previously lacked a one-stop-shop for readers that are interested in the security model and concerns of Backstage. So, we are happy to introduce the <a href="https://backstage.io/docs/overview/threat-model" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Backstage Threat Model</a>, which closes this gap. The Threat Model outlines key security considerations for operators, developers, and security researchers. It is a living document that will evolve and expand alongside the Backstage project.</p><p>The threat model document covers the trust model and roles involved in a typical Backstage setup, the responsibilities that fall on integrators of Backstage, and common configuration concerns across all Backstage projects. Beyond these three topics, it also dives deeper into a number of core features. The <code>auth</code>, <code>catalog</code>, <code>scaffolder</code>, and <code>techdocs</code> plugins are all covered separately with their individual security concerns.</p><p>We‚Äôd like to point out a few key parts in case you are in a rush. Be sure to familiarize yourself with the integrator's responsibility to protect the Backstage installation from unauthorized access. If you ingest organizational data into the catalog and use that to sign in users, you‚Äôll also want to check out the first halves of the authentication and catalog sections.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="links-and-references">Links and References<a href="#links-and-references" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Links and References" title="Direct link to Links and References">‚Äã</a></h2><ul><li><a href="https://backstage.io/blog/assets/22-08-23/X41-Backstage-Audit-2022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Full Audit Report</a></li><li><a href="https://backstage.io/docs/overview/threat-model" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Backstage Threat Model</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/SECURITY.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Backstage Security Policy</a></li></ul><p>On behalf of the Backstage maintainers and community: thanks to the CNCF, OSTIF, and X41 D-Sec for the opportunity to improve the project.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Note: This post was originally published on <a href="https://backstage.io/blog/2022/01/25/backstage-homepage-templates" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Backstage.io</a>.</em></p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="homepage template" src="/assets/images/homepage-template-blog-post-header-7a9ebc3d60195544bc7d4bbdb436554e.png" width="1200" height="600" class="img_ev3q"></p><p><em>TLDR;</em> We‚Äôre excited to announce the arrival of homepage templates for Backstage. It can be intimidating to build up your own instance of Backstage, so we decided to make your life a bit easier by giving you an out-of-the-box homepage to hit the ground running. This template can be found in our <a href="https://backstage.io/storybook/?path=/story/plugins-home-templates--default-template" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Backstage Storybook</a>, as well as future templates that we build.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-homepage-templates">Why homepage templates?<a href="#why-homepage-templates" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why homepage templates?" title="Direct link to Why homepage templates?">‚Äã</a></h2><p>At Spotify, the Backstage homepage is one of the most commonly used pages, primarily leveraged to quickly find and easily access things. Most of our users start off their Backstage experience on the homepage to quickly pivot to their intended destination. For example, folks generally prefer having a search bar available for quickly finding what they are looking for. Backstage users at Spotify also prefer having a central toolkit for navigating to tools that exist within the organization and for accessing their favorite entities and documentation pages.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Backstage homepage at Spotify" src="/assets/images/spotify-backstage-homepage-459466d64fb18fa5ecb895d92e099661.png" width="1999" height="1083" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>But we also know that all organizations look different and have different needs. Backstage is designed with this in mind, and so is the homepage plugin. You can modify and customize your version of the Home plugin so it fits with your needs. Sometimes customizing and configuring your app can be overwhelming to get started, with the <a href="https://backstage.io/storybook/?path=/story/plugins-home-templates--default-template" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">homepage templates</a> and components we can provide recommendations and guidelines to make adoption of Backstage more streamlined and simplified.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-are-homepage-templates">What are homepage templates?<a href="#what-are-homepage-templates" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What are homepage templates?" title="Direct link to What are homepage templates?">‚Äã</a></h2><p>A homepage template is just a template of what a homepage can look like. You can either copy it as a whole, or pick different components from it to use. The homepage templates live in our <a href="https://backstage.io/storybook/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Backstage Storybook</a> and we hope to see this collection grow with contributions from you all. If you don‚Äôt want to use one of the templates, you can pick and choose from our collection of <a href="https://backstage.io/storybook/?path=/story/plugins-home-components" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">homepage components</a> that you can use right out of the box and compose your own homepage. We‚Äôve included the <a href="https://backstage.io/storybook/?path=/story/plugins-home-components-searchbar--custom-styles" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SearchBar</a>, <a href="https://backstage.io/storybook/?path=/story/plugins-home-components-companylogo--custom-logo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CompanyLogo</a> and <a href="https://backstage.io/storybook/?path=/story/plugins-home-components-toolkit--default" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Toolkit</a> components in our Backstage Storybook as of today.

Because, yes, this is also your goal and your time to celebrate.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="so-what-is-backstage-10">So what is Backstage 1.0?<a href="#so-what-is-backstage-10" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to So what is Backstage 1.0?" title="Direct link to So what is Backstage 1.0?">‚Äã</a></h2><p>If you‚Äôre thinking ‚Äúwhat is Backstage 1.0, and what does it include?‚Äù You‚Äôre not alone, so let‚Äôs get into it.</p><p>To start, let‚Äôs define Backstage: it‚Äôs an open platform for building developer portals, mainly defined by a set of libraries together with plugins that can be added, removed, or customized so that the final behavior of the developer portal product is what an adopter wants. For the past two years, the open source platform has been in beta. With Backstage 1.0, we're coming out of beta and into production with regular versioning and release cycle commitments. So, if your company requires production-ready software, you can now use Backstage and join <a href="https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/ADOPTERS.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">over 100 other public adopters</a>!</p><p>Our definition of Backstage 1.0 includes:</p><ul><li>Backstage Core 1.0 libraries as the set of libraries to make the platform work</li><li><a href="https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-catalog/software-catalog-overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Backstage Software Catalog</a> 1.0</li><li><a href="https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-templates/software-templates-index" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Backstage Software Templates</a> 1.0</li><li><a href="https://backstage.io/docs/features/techdocs/techdocs-overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Backstage TechDocs</a> 1.0</li></ul><p>Coming soon: <a href="https://backstage.io/docs/features/search/search-overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Backstage Search</a> 1.0 will be included in the near future as part of the regular releases to the Backstage platform.</p><p>In terms of features, the maintainers will not be shipping new stuff as part of the major release but instead:</p><ul><li>Refactoring the code packaging to better reflect the release numbering</li><li>Removal of deprecated services to reduce the risk of introducing breaking changes</li><li>Establishing clarity on the release lifecycle, numbering, and cadence as well as the support model</li><li>Improvements to Backstage.io documentation</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-road-ahead">The road ahead<a href="#the-road-ahead" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The road ahead" title="Direct link to The road ahead">‚Äã</a></h2><p>In terms of maturity and stability, the road ahead for Backstage is bright and busy.

            <description><![CDATA[Learn about Backstage Upgrade Helper and how it can help you keep your application up-to-date in a simple way.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Note: This post was originally published on <a href="https://backstage.io/blog/2022/03/04/backstage-upgrade-helper" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Backstage.io</a>.</em></p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Backstage header" src="/assets/images/backstage-upgrade-helper-header-7644246a66a82cdaa842cecaa203d64e.png" width="1201" height="631" class="img_ev3q"></p><p><em>TLDR;</em> The Spotify team recently announced <a href="https://backstage.github.io/upgrade-helper" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Backstage Upgrade Helper</a>: a tool that helps adopters keep their Backstage application up-to-date. <strong>Spoiler alert</strong>: this is also a hidden and heartwarming tale about the beauty of open source innovation.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="upgrading-backstage-was-a-common-pain-point">Upgrading Backstage was a common pain point<a href="#upgrading-backstage-was-a-common-pain-point" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Upgrading Backstage was a common pain point" title="Direct link to Upgrading Backstage was a common pain point">‚Äã</a></h2><p>Without a doubt, one of the most exciting things about Backstage is our community. Step into our daily <a href="https://discord.gg/backstage-687207715902193673" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord conversations</a> and the monthly <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMQYSTKAx0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Community Sessions</a> and you‚Äôll find a ton of great ideas, problem-solving, and support for one another.</p><p>During one of these discussions, we realized we all shared the same pain point ‚Äî upgrading a Backstage application.</p><p>The Backstage open source project is in hyper-growth mode, where dozens of pull requests are merged each day. This means adopters need to go through the upgrade process more often in order to get the latest and greatest features. The Spotify team heard a lot of feedback about how painful and manual this process was ‚Äî so we decided to tackle this problem during one of our internal Hack Days.</p><p>At Spotify, we run Hack Days every month and a lot of ideas come from those sessions (in fact, the idea to open source Backstage itself <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/332yTwGiILGKTS7dsHCj2P" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">was born on a Hack Day</a>!). During a brainstorming session, we noticed that another open source community faced a similar upgrading problem years back and came up with a really good solution.</p><p>If you have ever worked on a React Native project, you might immediately recognize what we are referring to: The <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/upgrade-helper" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">React Native Upgrade Helper</a> ‚Äî a web tool to support React Native developers in upgrading their apps ‚Äî might have saved hours of your time. It certainly saved us hours of ours. So we looked into the project details and discovered it could fulfill our Backstage needs.</p><p>We started by creating a fork from React Native‚Äôs open source project, applying a few changes on top of it to introduce Backstage support, and ‚Äî <em>ecco</em> ‚Äî we had a new Backstage Upgrade Helper! In just a few days with pretty minimal effort, we created a product that would save a lot of time for the entire Backstage community. And we had fun at the same time (happy developers make happy code üòÅ ).</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="so-what-is-backstage-upgrade-helper">So what is Backstage Upgrade Helper?<a href="#so-what-is-backstage-upgrade-helper" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to So what is Backstage Upgrade Helper?" title="Direct link to So what is Backstage Upgrade Helper?">‚Äã</a></h2><p>The Backstage Upgrade Helper tool enables adopters to easily upgrade their Backstage app by using the power of git to create a diff between different versions.</p><p>Whenever a new version of Backstage is released, the Helper scaffolds a new dummy Backstage app using the <code>backstage-create-app</code> cli utility and checks all the generated files in a specific git branch. After the branch is generated, it gets compared with all the existing ones, which results in generating specific git patches stored in specific files. By selecting the version of the current Backstage release together with the version you want to upgrade to, the UI knows which patch file needs to be picked up.</p><p>So, now you can update your Backstage application in three steps rather than manually reading the changelogs of all the Backstage modules in reverse order.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="to-use-the-upgrade-helper-follow-these-simple-steps">To use the Upgrade Helper, follow these simple steps<a href="#to-use-the-upgrade-helper-follow-these-simple-steps" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to To use the Upgrade Helper, follow these simple steps" title="Direct link to To use the Upgrade Helper, follow these simple steps">‚Äã</a></h3><ol><li><p>Go to the <a href="https://backstage.github.io/upgrade-helper" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Backstage Upgrade Helper</a> and enter your current release and the release you would like to upgrade to.</p></li><li><p>Press <strong>Show me how to upgrade!</strong> After that, the feature spits out the changes between the two Backstage versions in a split-screen view for easy comparison.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Backstage Upgrade Helper in action" src="/assets/images/backstage-upgrade-helper-ee80827e66fe95f734561313920d2c35.gif" width="1200" height="794" class="img_ev3q"></p></li><li><p>Apply the suggested changes to your source code to correctly upgrade your app to the selected Backstage version. This will let you directly migrate from the version you‚Äôre currently using to the target version and skip all the intermediate steps you would have otherwise gone through manually reading all the changelogs.</p></li></ol><p><a href="https://youtu.be/nYjI2j-lWEM?t=410" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Watch the Upgrade Helper demo</a>.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="open-source-inspires">Open source inspires<a href="#open-source-inspires" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Open source inspires" title="Direct link to Open source inspires">‚Äã</a></h2><p>Thus far, the Backstage Upgrade Helper has gotten a lot of good feedback from the community and we‚Äôre sure to see awesome contributions in the future. But all the credit behind this idea goes to the React Native community.</p><p>With React Native‚Äôs open source contributions, we were able to quickly solve a tough problem for the entire Backstage community. Not only did React Native‚Äôs project save us time creating a new product, but it has also saved our adopters time upgrading Backstage.</p><p>This is why we love working in open source. The hard work done for one community has the power to influence and inspire another community. We hope Backstage can do the same and pay it forward to other open source projects.</p><p>For more Backstage Upgrade Helper resources, check out the <a href="https://github.com/backstage/upgrade-helper" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UI code</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/backstage/upgrade-helper-diff" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">git patches</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Read on for more information about our approach and future plans for authorization.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="our-proposal-for-an-open-flexible-authorization-framework">Our proposal for an open, flexible authorization framework<a href="#our-proposal-for-an-open-flexible-authorization-framework" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Our proposal for an open, flexible authorization framework" title="Direct link to Our proposal for an open, flexible authorization framework">‚Äã</a></h2><p>With Halloween just around the corner, we thought it would be a great time to talk about something that always has admins spooked: authorization.</p><p>While Backstage adopters and contributors bring so many different perspectives and organizational challenges, authorization has emerged as a common need ‚Äî even an outright blocker to adoption ‚Äî frequently requested by the community.</p><p>Backstage has many different <em>authentication</em> methods, but the project currently lacks built-in ways to <em>authorize</em> access to specific data, APIs, or interface actions ‚Äî these are all visible to any authenticated user.</p><p>We‚Äôve heard Backstage adopters share a broad range of authorization requirements: implementations like role-based access control (RBAC), attribute-based access control (ABAC), bespoke logic expressed in code, or integration with external authorization providers.</p><p>Our core belief is Backstage‚Äôs power stems from its flexibility and customization, so any authorization system should allow for many different authorization mechanisms. Today we‚Äôve published an authorization framework RFC in the Backstage GitHub repository that addresses permissions and authorization within a Backstage application, which we believe provides this flexibility. We‚Äôd love your feedback so please comment early and often ‚Äî the <a href="https://github.com/backstage/backstage/pull/7761" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RFC</a> will be open until Friday, November 5.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="our-plans-for-a-spotify-built-rbac-plugin">Our plans for a Spotify-built RBAC plugin<a href="#our-plans-for-a-spotify-built-rbac-plugin" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Our plans for a Spotify-built RBAC plugin" title="Direct link to Our plans for a Spotify-built RBAC plugin">‚Äã</a></h2><p>In between exploring Swedish archipelagoes (well, some of us), the Spotify team spent the summer with community members talking about RBAC and the need to make configuration powerful yet understandable. We learned a lot and are in active development of an RBAC plugin for Backstage ‚Äî which will build on the proposed authorization framework.</p><p>However, unlike previous plugin contributions, <strong>Spotify will retain ownership of our RBAC plugin and will license it under different terms</strong>. To be clear, we‚Äôre not backing away from core contributions. We believe the proposed open source authorization framework is suitable for many different permissions needs (but if you disagree, again please comment away in the RFC). We want people to build what works best for them. And we believe our RBAC solution will be a great option among other authorization mechanisms.</p><p>Our goal is to be as transparent as possible with this community so we will be sharing more details on the plugin development and distribution plan shortly. Feel free to hit us up on <a href="https://discord.gg/backstage-687207715902193673" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord</a> or in the repo if you have any questions in the meantime.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Note: This post was originally published on <a href="https://backstage.io/blog/2021/05/20/adopting-backstage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Backstage.io</a>.</em></p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Create, Manage, Explore" src="/assets/images/create-manage-explore-444d9c27660f47eac530d0762871921b.gif" width="1200" height="675" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>One of the greatest strengths of Backstage also presents a never-ending challenge: Backstage is highly customizable and allows you to easily build a unique developer portal suited to your organization‚Äôs needs. The downside of this flexibility is that it can be hard to know where to start. Backstage can do so many things ‚Äî integrating every part of your tech infrastructure and developer experience ‚Äî but if you set off building a developer portal without a plan, it‚Äôs easy to get overwhelmed by all the possibilities. To help you form your plan, this post will detail how Spotify came to design our internal portal and recommend potential models for you to use when designing and building your own.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="infrastructure-as-tech-culture">Infrastructure as tech culture<a href="#infrastructure-as-tech-culture" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Infrastructure as tech culture" title="Direct link to Infrastructure as tech culture">‚Äã</a></h2><p>Before providing recommendations on getting started with Backstage, it‚Äôs helpful to have a bit of context as to why Spotify made the design decisions we did. No two companies are identical ‚Äî and thus, no two Backstage implementations are the same.</p><p>Rolling back the clock just a few years, <a href="https://engineering.atspotify.com/2021/05/18/a-product-story-the-lessons-of-backstage-and-spotifys-autonomous-culture/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spotify was challenged</a> to continue to scale our engineering team (and the number of features and components built) but retain the speed of product development. Some user research with Spotify developers highlighted a clear problem: there was simply too much non-documented institutional knowledge needed to get things done. No one could find anything and everyone was interrupting everyone else trying to figure things out.</p><p>Spotify‚Äôs developers were facing three big challenges on a daily basis:</p><ul><li>They not only needed to build software quickly, they also needed to pass along knowledge to new joiners about how best to create new components.</li><li>They needed to somehow maintain a mental model of the systems their squad owned. (Or, if they were lucky, they found a hopefully-up-to-date spreadsheet tracking this information.)</li><li>They needed to keep an eye on what squads around them might be building to ensure they could reuse systems when they needed to solve similar problems in the future.</li></ul><p>In short, Spotify developers needed to continue building industry leading features at breakneck speed, while simultaneously maintaining a mental model for all the software at Spotify (oh, and help every new joiner develop that mental model as well!).</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="three-jobs-create-manage-explore">Three jobs: Create, manage, explore<a href="#three-jobs-create-manage-explore" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Three jobs: Create, manage, explore" title="Direct link to Three jobs: Create, manage, explore">‚Äã</a></h2><p>Around the same time, the <a href="https://hbr.org/2016/09/know-your-customers-jobs-to-be-done" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">jobs to be done</a> framework was becoming popular and luckily, a few Spotifiers helped guide the vision for a <em>sense-making tool for developers</em> toward using it. After user research and many failed attempts, we landed on three jobs Spotify developers needed to do consistently:</p><ul><li><strong>Create</strong>: Spotify developers want to delight their customers with incredible features. They create new software to do that.</li><li><strong>Manage</strong>: Spotify developers are proud of their work and treat their software and data like products. That requires maintaining all the software they own on an ongoing basis.</li><li><strong>Explore</strong>: Spotify developers want to solve new, yet unsolved problems. They try to build on existing systems to help them do that.</li></ul><p>So: make software, maintain the software you own throughout its lifecycle, and integrate with other people‚Äôs software.</p><p>Within today‚Äôs complex development environments, there are barriers both big and small that get in the way of those three jobs. Backstage provides the building blocks for removing those barriers, streamlining your development cycle, and letting developers do what they really want to do: build great features. Let‚Äôs take a closer look at each of these jobs.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Backstage Software Templates rocket" src="/assets/images/create-215d648acc18402a87d1608719c6fc0e.gif" width="320" height="320" class="img_ev3q"></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="create">Create<a href="#create" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Create" title="Direct link to Create">‚Äã</a></h3><p><strong>Job:</strong> You‚Äôre an engineer, ready to start building a new microservice. Do you just pick whatever framework you want? How do you reserve capacity to run your service in production? What about managing CI/CD?</p><p><strong>Tool:</strong> At Spotify, we use <strong>Backstage Software Templates</strong> to simplify all of this, reducing time‚Äìto‚ÄìHello World to just a few clicks. Instead of researching Spring Boot versus Helidon, opening a Jira ticket, rummaging through docs, and configuring CI automations, you just choose a template and your project is automatically set up in the repo for you, with the CI already running your first build.</p><p><strong>Result:</strong> By making it easier to start new projects, your engineers get to the good part of coding features faster. And your organization‚Äôs best practices are built into the templates, encouraging standards and reducing complexity in your tech ecosystem.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Backstage Service Catalog system" src="/assets/images/manage-7b2ba1637ca3b64ca5755fee13b427b7.gif" width="320" height="320" class="img_ev3q"></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="manage">Manage<a href="#manage" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Manage" title="Direct link to Manage">‚Äã</a></h3><p><strong>Job:</strong> You‚Äôre on a small team that owns a dozen services. Whenever you update and deploy those services, you‚Äôre switching between your CI, the AWS console, a security dashboard, and a CLI so you can try to figure out which Kubernetes cluster your service ended up on. In other words, you have a lot of open windows and tabs, and each step means switching to a new interface.</p><p><strong>Tool:</strong> All of your team‚Äôs software components are organized together on one page in the <strong>Backstage Service Catalog</strong>. Go to any service‚Äôs page from there and its CI/CD status, <a href="https://backstage.io/blog/2021/01/12/new-backstage-feature-kubernetes-for-service-owners" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kubernetes deployment status</a>, documentation, security checks ‚Äî and everything else related to that service ‚Äî is grouped together in one seamless interface that shows you only the info you want.</p><p><strong>Result</strong>: One page in Backstage has everything you need to manage the software you own. No more context-switching. No more digging through your cloud provider‚Äôs obscure admin features. Outside the repo and your IDE, everything you need to manage your service is right inside Backstage.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Backstage explorer" src="/assets/images/explore-6a463d64e28b2e845f986504acc3e9a6.gif" width="320" height="320" class="img_ev3q"></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="explore">Explore<a href="#explore" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Explore" title="Direct link to Explore">‚Äã</a></h3><p><strong>Job:</strong> You're building a new mobile feature that needs to ensure a user is paying for the premium version of your product ‚Äî but someone must‚Äôve already built a library that handles that, right? A company-wide email and a few calls for help on Slack yield no response, so you resign yourself to building the capability yourself. Turns out someone did build the library you needed. They were just on vacation so they didn‚Äôt see your messages. How do you enable better discovery and collaboration across your org?</p><p><strong>Tools:</strong> At Spotify, anyone can find everyone else‚Äôs software ‚Äî because everything is centralized inside Backstage, organized by the <strong>Backstage Service Catalog</strong> and accessible by <strong>search</strong>. Go to any library or services page, and you‚Äôll find the owners and documentation, even its API and how to extend it if need be.</p><p><strong>Result:</strong> One place for everything, one place to search. Developers can more easily share components, build on top of each other‚Äôs work, and discover tools, libraries, frameworks, documentation, system designs, org charts, and more.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="sounds-great-where-do-i-start">Sounds great.

Where do I start?">‚Äã</a></h2><p>After talking with companies who have already adopted Backstage, we‚Äôve seen a few common strategies for getting started. The different strategies are based on the size of your engineering org (which often also corresponds with how fast you‚Äôre growing).</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="200 engineers" src="/assets/images/200-engineers-3d654b957ad918913b1e6bb411998f43.png" width="1200" height="526" class="img_ev3q"></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="my-org-has-200-engineers-and-is-growing-fast">My org has ~200 engineers (and is growing fast)<a href="#my-org-has-200-engineers-and-is-growing-fast" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to My org has ~200 engineers (and is growing fast)" title="Direct link to My org has ~200 engineers (and is growing fast)">‚Äã</a></h3><p>You‚Äôre big enough to start feeling the pain, and only getting bigger. Onboarding and discoverability are your biggest challenges.</p><p><strong>Pain points:</strong></p><ul><li>This size seems to be the tipping point ‚Äî where complexity is taking hold, collaboration starts breaking down, and ad hoc solutions stop working.</li><li>Often this is also when you‚Äôre growing so fast (doubling in size every 6‚Äì12 months) that there are now more new engineers than old engineers.</li><li>New engineers can‚Äôt find anything, so they ask around, which pulls all your other engineers off-task with interruptions.</li><li>Logjams form. One company told us how it was taking 3‚Äì4 days for pull requests to get merged.</li></ul><p><strong>Recommendation ‚Äî Explore, then create:</strong></p><ul><li>New engineers need an easy way to find out how to do things, so you‚Äôre not just adding bodies, you‚Äôre adding happy, productive contributors.</li><li>To streamline onboarding, start with centralizing your documentation and making your tools and software components discoverable in Backstage.</li><li>At this size, you might not have a dedicated platform/infra team in place yet, but Backstage can provide the framework for centralizing and sharing knowledge ‚Äî from managing compliance requirements to finding the right API documentation.</li><li>This allows both new and old engineers to collaborate more efficiently, easily discover best practices, and cuts down on duplicated work (e.g., a new team doesn‚Äôt end up rebuilding a database that already exists but nobody can find).</li></ul><p><img loading="lazy" alt="1,000 engineers" src="/assets/images/1000-engineers-d2f20769738c19e2c377025e76ca100d.png" width="1200" height="526" class="img_ev3q"></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="my-org-has-1000-engineers">My org has ~1,000 engineers<a href="#my-org-has-1000-engineers" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to My org has ~1,000 engineers" title="Direct link to My org has ~1,000 engineers">‚Äã</a></h3><p>You‚Äôre officially big. Lots and lots of teams are managing lots and lots of software ‚Äî and the frustration of switching between all the various tools to do that is growing exponentially.</p><p><strong>Pain points:</strong></p><ul><li>Fragmentation and entropy are real threats to productivity. From security requirements to cluster management to a thousand data endpoints, there‚Äôs too much to keep track of, leading to cognitive overload.</li><li>A death by a thousand cuts: constantly logging into new interfaces ‚Äî from your cloud provider‚Äôs console to some brand new security tool then back to your CI/CD ‚Äî is bogging your engineers down with too much context-switching and a lot of noise.</li><li>Every day, it‚Äôs getting more and more difficult for one team to manage their own microservices, data, and documentation, let alone share their knowledge with other teams.</li></ul><p><strong>Recommendation ‚Äî Manage, then explore, then create:</strong></p><ul><li>Backstage will allow your teams to get a handle on the software they own, since everything they need to manage it is in one place.</li><li>From CI/CD status to documentation to deciphering a monorepo, Backstage makes it easy to manage a service (or other software component) on a day-to-day basis.</li><li>The service catalog also helps your developers visualize your existing software ecosystem, beyond the software they own. And with Backstage Software Templates, every new software component is already added to the catalog.</li><li>Even at this scale, a small platform team should be all it takes to build and maintain your own version of Backstage. At Spotify, we have a 4-person team responsible for our internal version of Backstage, which is used by all of Spotify‚Äôs 1,600+ developers.</li></ul><p><img loading="lazy" alt="More than 1,000 engineers" src="/assets/images/1000-plus-engineers-fdd6a4f2885b03ad2267de432d330c24.png" width="1200" height="526" class="img_ev3q"></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="my-org-has-1000-engineers-1">My org has 1,000+ engineers<a href="#my-org-has-1000-engineers-1" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to My org has 1,000+ engineers" title="Direct link to My org has 1,000+ engineers">‚Äã</a></h3><p>Integrating infrastructure of this size and complexity can seem overwhelming. It‚Äôs an even bigger challenge to bring this level of change to a well-established culture with ingrained processes.</p><p><strong>Pain points:</strong></p><ul><li>When you‚Äôre this large, you‚Äôve incorporated a lot of technology and processes, as well as a lot of partners, each with their own technologies and processes.</li><li>You‚Äôre focussed on ‚Äúreplacing cruft‚Äù and bringing discoverability and order to your vast ecosystem of components and tools.</li><li>Getting your tools adopted by your engineers while modernizing your tech stack and coordinating with your infra teams to improve your engineering practices across the whole company‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a lot.</li></ul><p><strong>Recommendation ‚Äî Create, then manage, then explore:</strong></p><ul><li>The fastest way to bring change to your ecosystem is to start at the beginning of the chain with Backstage Software Templates.</li><li>With every new component created with your templates, you‚Äôre establishing best practices and rewarding your developers with a streamlined experience focused on their needs ‚Äî all the while building up your new service catalog.</li><li>The more the templates ease the process of starting up a project, the more your engineers will adopt them, and the faster the other benefits of Backstage will build up, transforming productivity across your organization.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Note: AWS published the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/toyota-ecs-case-study/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">original case study</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZpll0dJlnM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a>.</em></p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Toyota header image" src="/assets/images/preview-fa776edfe57895fb16a0cfb96c4af183.png" width="2500" height="1313" class="img_ev3q"></p><p><strong>tl;dr</strong> <a href="https://www.toyota.com/usa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Toyota Motor North America</a> (TMNA) <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/toyota-ecs-case-study/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recently shared</a> how they combined the power of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon Web Services</a> (AWS) and <a href="http://backstage.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Backstage</a> to securely deploy applications faster and save $10 million in annual costs. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="from-stuck-in-neutral-to-gassed-up">From stuck-in-neutral to gassed up<a href="#from-stuck-in-neutral-to-gassed-up" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to From stuck-in-neutral to gassed up" title="Direct link to From stuck-in-neutral to gassed up">‚Äã</a></h3><p>As TMNA matured its cloud development strategy, engineering teams were running into increased friction and bottlenecks in its highly manual deployment process. They needed to find a tool that would simplify and streamline creating new apps on AWS and allow their developers to build quickly and easily while adhering to best practices and security requirements. And that‚Äôs where Backstage came in‚Ä¶. </p><p>AWS supported TMNA to solve this problem through a developer portal built off the Backstage core framework. The result was a shiny, new internal development platform called ‚ÄúChofer‚Äù ‚Äî Spanish for ‚Äúchauffeur‚Äù as an homage to Toyota‚Äôs manufacturing presence in Mexico. </p><p>Today, Chofer supports 100+ application teams, 1,600+ cloud applications, and 40+ AWS services ‚Äì helping the company save money by deploying secure, modern applications at scale more quickly than ever before.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="streamlining-to-a-single-interface">Streamlining to a single interface<a href="#streamlining-to-a-single-interface" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Streamlining to a single interface" title="Direct link to Streamlining to a single interface">‚Äã</a></h3><p>TMNA spent six months in late 2020 assembling the team to build their Backstage instance and working with AWS to map out their project needs. They started building out the Chofer frontend in February 2021 and, in a few short months, the team released an MVP Chofer for TMNA developers to start using. </p><p>Over time, Chofer has grown to unify infrastructure tooling, services, training, observability, cost tracking, infrastructure scaffolding, and documentation into a single streamlined development interface. Chofer‚Äôs goal is to take the guesswork out of the equation for developers allowing them to create new apps and templates quickly and at scale in partnership with its security teams. </p><p>As Kishore Jonnalagedda, Director of Engineering at TMNA, says: ‚ÄúSecurity patterns and scalability are already taken into account. All these things ‚Äì capacity, operations, cost optimization, cost transparency, and security ‚Äì are being built into the application without the application team having to think of them in detail.‚Äù</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="going-placesa-lot-faster">Going places...a lot faster<a href="#going-placesa-lot-faster" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Going places...a lot faster" title="Direct link to Going places...a lot faster">‚Äã</a></h3><p>Because Backstage is cloud-agnostic, TMNA was able to customize Backstage according to their AWS needs and make their AWS deployments go even faster. Specifically, TMNA used Backstage‚Äôs <a href="https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-templates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Software Templates</a> and <a href="https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-catalog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Software Catalog</a> to program 40+ templates so that developers can easily deploy containerized applications using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon ECS</a> or <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/eks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon EKS</a>, for example. Additionally, they‚Äôve configured their Backstage app to implement specific backend parameters across different AWS regions and create dashboards that track cost expenditure.</p><p>The combined power of the self-service catalog and software templates allows TMNA developers to move faster. Now, developers can ship projects in a matter of weeks, not quarters. In fact, one team reported that they saved six weeks of effort ‚Äî equivalent to $250,000 ‚Äî with these improvements by not having to build a particular application from scratch.</p><p>The TMNA cloud team can also ensure deployments are backward compatible and upgraded along with CI/CD pipelines, saving its application teams an additional estimated 4-6 weeks on these tasks.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="a-big-win-for-the-bottom-line">A big win for the bottom line<a href="#a-big-win-for-the-bottom-line" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to A big win for the bottom line" title="Direct link to A big win for the bottom line">‚Äã</a></h3><p>As a result of its increased developer productivity, TMNA saw an overall cost reduction of more than $10 million in 2022 ‚Äì as well as a reduction of around $5 million in annual cloud infrastructure costs, saving up to $96,000 in infrastructure costs per team. </p><p>TMNA was also able to track its go-green initiatives using Chofer‚Äôs Cloud Carbon Footprint tool, which reveals the various TMNA teams‚Äô carbon footprints, their cloud spend, and their cost optimization recommendations.</p><p>Ultimately, by leveraging the power of AWS and Backstage, TMNA saw a reduction in costs, with a huge impact on developer effectiveness. Now, its application teams are working to further their cloud competencies and showcase their cloud expertise through blogs and training ‚Äì helping other teams to adopt Chofer and bring Backstage‚Äôs many benefits to other areas of the business.</p><p>Read the original case study <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/toyota-ecs-case-study/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.

Their distributed development teams work together to create an ‚Äúend-to-end online self-service experience in the real estate market.‚Äù </p><p>They adopted Backstage to help their engineers <a href="https://backstage.spotify.com/blog/adopting-backstage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">create, manage, and explore</a> their tech ecosystem. In a recent post on their <a href="https://medium.com/quintoandar-tech-blog/how-we-are-improving-developer-experience-at-quintoandar-with-backstage-io-fa1ab70b75cb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">QuintoAndar Tech Blog</a>, engineer Gabriel Dantas describes how their platform team built their Backstage-powered service catalog to create a ‚Äúsource of truth‚Äù for all their services.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="bookmarks-and-spreadsheets-oh-my">Bookmarks and spreadsheets, oh my<a href="#bookmarks-and-spreadsheets-oh-my" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Bookmarks and spreadsheets, oh my" title="Direct link to Bookmarks and spreadsheets, oh my">‚Äã</a></h2><p>Before adopting Backstage, QuintoAndar‚Äôs developers were managing their tools with browser bookmarks and using a spreadsheet as a services directory (hey, <a href="https://backstage.spotify.com/blog/kubecon-na-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">we‚Äôve all been there</a> üò¨). </p><p>That might work when you‚Äôre a small team working in the same room, but over the last two years, QuintoAndar‚Äôs business had grown 4x and wasn‚Äôt showing any signs of slowing down. As we saw with fintech <a href="https://backstage.spotify.com/blog/community-session/11-brex-backstage-upgrade-helper/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brex</a>, when your startup is growing quickly, complexity comes at you fast, with your headcount growing along with your infrastructure. </p><p>   From Gabriel Dantas' post:</p><blockquote><p>It is typical for developers to use more than one tool in their daily development, such as ArgoCD, Drone CI, Grafana, Thanos, and Kibana.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Inside QuintoAndar the tools are dynamically provisioned and can have their addresses changed. This means that addresses that were saved in the favorites bar or in documentation were deprecated with a certain frequency. Keeping our developers up to date with news is always a challenge and not addressing this issue has a strong impact on engineering productivity.</p></blockquote><p>Not only was QuintoAndar managing tools with bookmarks and spreadsheets ‚Äî but also the local addresses and owners for their tools changed on a steady cadence. So the information on these tools often became deprecated, outdated, and lacked awareness. The disjointed approach hurt internal productivity for developers. QuintoAndar needed a source of truth for their tools that remained up-to-date and acted as an easily discoverable and usable developer hub for the entire company.  </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="out-with-the-old-and-in-with-the-new">Out with the old and in with the new<a href="#out-with-the-old-and-in-with-the-new" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Out with the old and in with the new" title="Direct link to Out with the old and in with the new">‚Äã</a></h2><p>QuintoAndar knew that managing tools via bookmarks and spreadsheets was not sustainable alongside their rapid growth. So, they turned to Backstage to help mitigate the spreadsheet chaos. Within Backstage, they found the <a href="https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-catalog/software-catalog-overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Software Catalog</a> the most helpful.</p><p>   Gabriel Dantas:</p><blockquote><p>With Backstage we are able to expose in a unified way everything that is needed to create and maintain infrastructure resources, follow CI/CD pipelines, and visualize observability metrics, without the developer needing to have specific knowledge about the tools, being a true hub of information for any developer within the company.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Remember the spreadsheet? It was time to kill it with fire.</p></blockquote><p>The Software Catalog enabled them to highlight and unify tooling required to create and maintain infrastructure, follow CI/CD pipelines, and visualize observability metrics, without the developer needing to have specific knowledge about the tools. They found the Software Catalog to be a source of truth for every developer in the company. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="from-chaos-to-creators">From chaos to creators<a href="#from-chaos-to-creators" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to From chaos to creators" title="Direct link to From chaos to creators">‚Äã</a></h2><p>QuintoAndar didn‚Äôt stop upgrading their developer experience just with the Software Catalog. They integrated Backstage into their production workloads with custom yaml and even created a number of their own plugins. And the most exciting part? QuintoAndar created three new plugins (Security Overview, Service Assessment, and Toolbox) that they plan to contribute to the Backstage Open Source community soon! THANK YOU QuintoAndar! </p><p>QuintoAndar went from struggling with managing developer tools with bookmarks and spreadsheets to not only solving their own challenges, but sharing tools to combat challenges that other companies face.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Note: This post was originally published on <a href="https://backstage.io/blog/2021/09/30/50-public-adopters" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Backstage.io</a>.</em></p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Celebrating all of Backstage‚Äôs 50+ adopters." src="/assets/images/50-public-adopters-43ea4cf662591cc225eb5ddaf577334b.png" width="1201" height="631" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>We‚Äôre excited to celebrate an important milestone for the Backstage community: 50+ <a href="https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/ADOPTERS.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">public adopters</a>!</p><p>Before digging into why we believe this is so important, we want to send a huge ‚Äúthank you‚Äù to all the Backstage adopters and contributors who have helped grow the Backstage community. First, to the publicly listed adopters as your visible support for the project excites others to learn more about Backstage. Second, to those non-listed adopters, many of whom still engage in the community via issues, comments, or code contributions. Thank you!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-we-care-about-public-adopters">Why we care about public adopters<a href="#why-we-care-about-public-adopters" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why we care about public adopters" title="Direct link to Why we care about public adopters">‚Äã</a></h2><p><img loading="lazy" alt="The pace of public adoption has accelerated over the last year" src="/assets/images/public-backstage-adopters-64b9fc8f6a1fcae9f801610bba5774b7.png" width="1200" height="630" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>If you roll the clock back to early 2020 when Backstage was open sourced, we never could‚Äôve imagined surpassing this milestone. It feels particularly big given that Backstage tends to be adopted by complex organizations with hundreds (if not thousands of) developers and thousands (if not tens of thousands) of software components.</p><p>We‚Äôve also seen such diverse examples of Backstage in the wild. Adopters as varied as <a href="https://backstage.spotify.com/blog/adopter-spotlight/american-airlines-runway/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">American Airlines</a> and <a href="https://backstage.spotify.com/blog/community-session/splunk-pink-phonebook/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Splunk</a> have demoed their Backstage-built developer portals. We‚Äôve seen digital-first companies like <a href="https://youtu.be/6sg5uMCLxTA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zalando</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/dazn-tech/developer-experience-dx-at-dazn-e6de9a0208d2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DAZN</a> share their journey from proof-of-concept to in-production. And the developer experience team at <a href="https://backstage.spotify.com/blog/community-session/firehydrant-expedia-loblaw/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Expedia Group</a> has been shared at multiple Community Sessions, detailing their adoption journey as well as contributing back with ideas for new features.</p><p>For the Backstage project, public adopters are important because they provide a wide variety of use cases, industries, and degrees of complexity (teams, number of services, etc.) that Backstage is able to support. In addition, a growing adopters list shows the project‚Äôs maturity and helps other organizations understand the benefits and make the decision to join the project and the community.</p><p>In other words, the more the public adopters list grows and becomes more diverse, the more the community will grow and provide contributions that benefit all adopters.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="fifty-is-just-the-beginning">Fifty is just the beginning<a href="#fifty-is-just-the-beginning" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Fifty is just the beginning" title="Direct link to Fifty is just the beginning">‚Äã</a></h2><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Backstage is growing: 52+ pull requests per week, excluding maintainers. Over 13,000 stars on GitHub. 518 total contributors, with about 7+ new contributors per week." src="/assets/images/backstage-stats-3c031536abacf43a29118a0da9efa8d8.png" width="1200" height="316" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>While we‚Äôre thrilled to celebrate this milestone, the public adopters list is just one metric we monitor in the overall health of the Backstage project. It definitely doesn‚Äôt tell the whole story! We‚Äôre seeing continued growth within the contributor community, PRs, and GitHub overall ratings as well. As fate would have it, we also recently reached 50+ plugins in the <a href="https://backstage.io/plugins" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Backstage Plugin Marketplace</a>!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="join-us">Join us!<a href="#join-us" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Join us!" title="Direct link to Join us!">‚Äã</a></h2><p>If you are a Backstage enthusiast, please <a href="https://info.backstage.spotify.com/newsletter_subscribe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">join me</a> and the entire Backstage Team in celebrating this milestone. And if you are a Backstage adopter not already listed in the <a href="https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/ADOPTERS.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub page</a>, consider adding your name to better inform the community and participate in the project.</p>]]></content:encoded>
