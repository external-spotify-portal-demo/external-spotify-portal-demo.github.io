height="1313" class="img_ev3q"></p><p><strong>tl;dr</strong> <a href="https://www.toyota.com/usa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Toyota Motor North America</a> (TMNA) <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/toyota-ecs-case-study/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recently shared</a> how they combined the power of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon Web Services</a> (AWS) and <a href="http://backstage.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Backstage</a> to securely deploy applications faster and save $10 million in annual costs. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="from-stuck-in-neutral-to-gassed-up">From stuck-in-neutral to gassed up<a href="#from-stuck-in-neutral-to-gassed-up" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to From stuck-in-neutral to gassed up" title="Direct link to From stuck-in-neutral to gassed up">​</a></h3><p>As TMNA matured its cloud development strategy, engineering teams were running into increased friction and bottlenecks in its highly manual deployment process. They needed to find a tool that would simplify and streamline creating new apps on AWS and allow their developers to build quickly and easily while adhering to best practices and security requirements. And that’s where Backstage came in…. </p><p>AWS supported TMNA to solve this problem through a developer portal built off the Backstage core framework. The result was a shiny, new internal development platform called “Chofer” — Spanish for “chauffeur” as an homage to Toyota’s manufacturing presence in Mexico. </p><p>Today, Chofer supports 100+ application teams, 1,600+ cloud applications, and 40+ AWS services – helping the company save money by deploying secure, modern applications at scale more quickly than ever before.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="streamlining-to-a-single-interface">Streamlining to a single interface<a href="#streamlining-to-a-single-interface" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Streamlining to a single interface" title="Direct link to Streamlining to a single interface">​</a></h3><p>TMNA spent six months in late 2020 assembling the team to build their Backstage instance and working with AWS to map out their project needs. They started building out the Chofer frontend in February 2021 and, in a few short months, the team released an MVP Chofer for TMNA developers to start using. </p><p>Over time, Chofer has grown to unify infrastructure tooling, services, training, observability, cost tracking, infrastructure scaffolding, and documentation into a single streamlined development interface. Chofer’s goal is to take the guesswork out of the equation for developers allowing them to create new apps and templates quickly and at scale in partnership with its security teams. </p><p>As Kishore Jonnalagedda, Director of Engineering at TMNA, says: “Security patterns and scalability are already taken into account. All these things – capacity, operations, cost optimization, cost transparency, and security – are being built into the application without the application team having to think of them in detail.”</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="going-placesa-lot-faster">Going places...a lot faster<a href="#going-placesa-lot-faster" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Going places...a lot faster" title="Direct link to Going places...a lot faster">​</a></h3><p>Because Backstage is cloud-agnostic, TMNA was able to customize Backstage according to their AWS needs and make their AWS deployments go even faster. Specifically, TMNA used Backstage’s <a href="https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-templates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Software Templates</a> and <a href="https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-catalog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Software Catalog</a> to program 40+ templates so that developers can easily deploy containerized applications using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon ECS</a> or <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/eks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon EKS</a>, for example. Additionally, they’ve configured their Backstage app to implement specific backend parameters across different AWS regions and create dashboards that track cost expenditure.</p><p>The combined power of the self-service catalog and software templates allows TMNA developers to move faster. Now, developers can ship projects in a matter of weeks, not quarters. In fact, one team reported that they saved six weeks of effort — equivalent to $250,000 — with these improvements by not having to build a particular application from scratch.</p><p>The TMNA cloud team can also ensure deployments are backward compatible and upgraded along with CI/CD pipelines, saving its application teams an additional estimated 4-6 weeks on these tasks.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="a-big-win-for-the-bottom-line">A big win for the bottom line<a href="#a-big-win-for-the-bottom-line" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to A big win for the bottom line" title="Direct link to A big win for the bottom line">​</a></h3><p>As a result of its increased developer productivity, TMNA saw an overall cost reduction of more than $10 million in 2022 – as well as a reduction of around $5 million in annual cloud infrastructure costs, saving up to $96,000 in infrastructure costs per team. </p><p>TMNA was also able to track its go-green initiatives using Chofer’s Cloud Carbon Footprint tool, which reveals the various TMNA teams’ carbon footprints, their cloud spend, and their cost optimization recommendations.</p><p>Ultimately, by leveraging the power of AWS and Backstage, TMNA saw a reduction in costs, with a huge impact on developer effectiveness. Now, its application teams are working to further their cloud competencies and showcase their cloud expertise through blogs and training – helping other teams to adopt Chofer and bring Backstage’s many benefits to other areas of the business.</p><p>Read the original case study <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/toyota-ecs-case-study/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.

Their distributed development teams work together to create an “end-to-end online self-service experience in the real estate market.” </p><p>They adopted Backstage to help their engineers <a href="https://backstage.spotify.com/blog/adopting-backstage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">create, manage, and explore</a> their tech ecosystem. In a recent post on their <a href="https://medium.com/quintoandar-tech-blog/how-we-are-improving-developer-experience-at-quintoandar-with-backstage-io-fa1ab70b75cb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">QuintoAndar Tech Blog</a>, engineer Gabriel Dantas describes how their platform team built their Backstage-powered service catalog to create a “source of truth” for all their services.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="bookmarks-and-spreadsheets-oh-my">Bookmarks and spreadsheets, oh my<a href="#bookmarks-and-spreadsheets-oh-my" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Bookmarks and spreadsheets, oh my" title="Direct link to Bookmarks and spreadsheets, oh my">​</a></h2><p>Before adopting Backstage, QuintoAndar’s developers were managing their tools with browser bookmarks and using a spreadsheet as a services directory (hey, <a href="https://backstage.spotify.com/blog/kubecon-na-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">we’ve all been there</a> 😬). </p><p>That might work when you’re a small team working in the same room, but over the last two years, QuintoAndar’s business had grown 4x and wasn’t showing any signs of slowing down. As we saw with fintech <a href="https://backstage.spotify.com/blog/community-session/11-brex-backstage-upgrade-helper/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brex</a>, when your startup is growing quickly, complexity comes at you fast, with your headcount growing along with your infrastructure. </p><p>   From Gabriel Dantas&#x27; post:</p><blockquote><p>It is typical for developers to use more than one tool in their daily development, such as ArgoCD, Drone CI, Grafana, Thanos, and Kibana.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Inside QuintoAndar the tools are dynamically provisioned and can have their addresses changed. This means that addresses that were saved in the favorites bar or in documentation were deprecated with a certain frequency. Keeping our developers up to date with news is always a challenge and not addressing this issue has a strong impact on engineering productivity.</p></blockquote><p>Not only was QuintoAndar managing tools with bookmarks and spreadsheets — but also the local addresses and owners for their tools changed on a steady cadence. So the information on these tools often became deprecated, outdated, and lacked awareness. The disjointed approach hurt internal productivity for developers. QuintoAndar needed a source of truth for their tools that remained up-to-date and acted as an easily discoverable and usable developer hub for the entire company.  </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="out-with-the-old-and-in-with-the-new">Out with the old and in with the new<a href="#out-with-the-old-and-in-with-the-new" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Out with the old and in with the new" title="Direct link to Out with the old and in with the new">​</a></h2><p>QuintoAndar knew that managing tools via bookmarks and spreadsheets was not sustainable alongside their rapid growth. So, they turned to Backstage to help mitigate the spreadsheet chaos. Within Backstage, they found the <a href="https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-catalog/software-catalog-overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Software Catalog</a> the most helpful.</p><p>   Gabriel Dantas:</p><blockquote><p>With Backstage we are able to expose in a unified way everything that is needed to create and maintain infrastructure resources, follow CI/CD pipelines, and visualize observability metrics, without the developer needing to have specific knowledge about the tools, being a true hub of information for any developer within the company.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Remember the spreadsheet? It was time to kill it with fire.</p></blockquote><p>The Software Catalog enabled them to highlight and unify tooling required to create and maintain infrastructure, follow CI/CD pipelines, and visualize observability metrics, without the developer needing to have specific knowledge about the tools. They found the Software Catalog to be a source of truth for every developer in the company. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="from-chaos-to-creators">From chaos to creators<a href="#from-chaos-to-creators" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to From chaos to creators" title="Direct link to From chaos to creators">​</a></h2><p>QuintoAndar didn’t stop upgrading their developer experience just with the Software Catalog. They integrated Backstage into their production workloads with custom yaml and even created a number of their own plugins. And the most exciting part? QuintoAndar created three new plugins (Security Overview, Service Assessment, and Toolbox) that they plan to contribute to the Backstage Open Source community soon! THANK YOU QuintoAndar! </p><p>QuintoAndar went from struggling with managing developer tools with bookmarks and spreadsheets to not only solving their own challenges, but sharing tools to combat challenges that other companies face.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/adopter-spotlight/dazn">Adopter Spotlight: DAZN scores with Backstage</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2023-07-13T12:03:52.805Z" itemprop="datePublished">July 13, 2023</time> · <!-- -->3 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><span itemprop="name">Helen Greul, Spotify</span></div></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Backstage spotlight on DAZN" src="/assets/images/dazn-spotlight-15b73791cf587437a319b3389fb2da42.png" width="1200" height="630" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>International sports streamer <a href="https://www.dazn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DAZN</a> has about 500 software engineers distributed around the world. They also have a 12-person developer experience team dedicated to serving them.

Backstage. DAZN recently wrote about how they got their Backstage developer portal up and running. Turns out, they had a good head start.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="step-1-yaml-files-for-everyone">Step 1: YAML files for everyone<a href="#step-1-yaml-files-for-everyone" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Step 1: YAML files for everyone" title="Direct link to Step 1: YAML files for everyone">​</a></h2><p>DAZN had a unique advantage when they decided to adopt Backstage. To help track ownership and documentation for their microservices and other components, they had already started creating YAML files describing their services in all their repos. The metadata in these custom manifest files was useful — but the information was scattered in repos across the org.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="step-2-instant-software-catalog">Step 2: Instant software catalog<a href="#step-2-instant-software-catalog" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Step 2: Instant software catalog" title="Direct link to Step 2: Instant software catalog">​</a></h2><p>Luckily, all they had to do was ingest those YAML files into Backstage — and, voila, they had a working developer portal, complete with a centralized software catalog:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="DAZN’s software catalog inside Backstage" src="/assets/images/dazn-catalog-c2f47836f1a7139d1379cbd6a56162b3.png" title="DAZN imported their custom manifest files into Backstage to create a centralized software catalog." width="1246" height="458" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>This proved to be a real game changer for DAZN’s 500 developers.

First, to the publicly listed adopters as your visible support for the project excites others to learn more about Backstage. Second, to those non-listed adopters, many of whom still engage in the community via issues, comments, or code contributions. Thank you!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-we-care-about-public-adopters">Why we care about public adopters<a href="#why-we-care-about-public-adopters" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why we care about public adopters" title="Direct link to Why we care about public adopters">​</a></h2><p><img loading="lazy" alt="The pace of public adoption has accelerated over the last year" src="/assets/images/public-backstage-adopters-64b9fc8f6a1fcae9f801610bba5774b7.png" width="1200" height="630" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>If you roll the clock back to early 2020 when Backstage was open sourced, we never could’ve imagined surpassing this milestone. It feels particularly big given that Backstage tends to be adopted by complex organizations with hundreds (if not thousands of) developers and thousands (if not tens of thousands) of software components.</p><p>We’ve also seen such diverse examples of Backstage in the wild. Adopters as varied as <a href="https://backstage.spotify.com/blog/adopter-spotlight/american-airlines-runway/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">American Airlines</a> and <a href="https://backstage.spotify.com/blog/community-session/splunk-pink-phonebook/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Splunk</a> have demoed their Backstage-built developer portals. We’ve seen digital-first companies like <a href="https://youtu.be/6sg5uMCLxTA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zalando</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/dazn-tech/developer-experience-dx-at-dazn-e6de9a0208d2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DAZN</a> share their journey from proof-of-concept to in-production. And the developer experience team at <a href="https://backstage.spotify.com/blog/community-session/firehydrant-expedia-loblaw/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Expedia Group</a> has been shared at multiple Community Sessions, detailing their adoption journey as well as contributing back with ideas for new features.</p><p>For the Backstage project, public adopters are important because they provide a wide variety of use cases, industries, and degrees of complexity (teams, number of services, etc.) that Backstage is able to support. In addition, a growing adopters list shows the project’s maturity and helps other organizations understand the benefits and make the decision to join the project and the community.</p><p>In other words, the more the public adopters list grows and becomes more diverse, the more the community will grow and provide contributions that benefit all adopters.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="fifty-is-just-the-beginning">Fifty is just the beginning<a href="#fifty-is-just-the-beginning" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Fifty is just the beginning" title="Direct link to Fifty is just the beginning">​</a></h2><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Backstage is growing: 52+ pull requests per week, excluding maintainers.

It definitely doesn’t tell the whole story! We’re seeing continued growth within the contributor community, PRs, and GitHub overall ratings as well. As fate would have it, we also recently reached 50+ plugins in the <a href="https://backstage.io/plugins" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Backstage Plugin Marketplace</a>!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="join-us">Join us!<a href="#join-us" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Join us!" title="Direct link to Join us!">​</a></h2><p>If you are a Backstage enthusiast, please <a href="https://info.backstage.spotify.com/newsletter_subscribe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">join me</a> and the entire Backstage Team in celebrating this milestone.
