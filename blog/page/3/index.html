One important change includes stabilizing core APIs in the scaffolder and catalog plugins. Most of these changes will be in the underlying typescript APIs.</p></li><li><p><strong>More on Homepage Templates!</strong>: We launched Homepage templates on January 25, which allows you to customize your Backstage homepage! In this Community Session, we follow up to <a href="https://backstage.io/blog/2022/01/25/backstage-homepage-templates" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this blog post on Homepage templates</a> with a demo and roadmap ideas for the new feature. Spotify’s Himanshu Mishra takes us through a demo on how to get started with Homepage Templates followed by Emma Indal reviewing components and reveals that we are designing two more Homepage Templates. Check out <a href="https://backstage.io/docs/getting-started/homepage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this Getting Started tutorial</a> for step-by-step instructions on updating your homepage.</p></li><li><p><strong>Discover useful info with Catalog entity insights</strong>: Spotify’s Fredrik Adelöw shows us how to unearth useful information about any catalog entity. By clicking the three dots menu in the upper right hand corner of your entity views in Backstage, you can find information like raw yaml, uid, ancestry data, and other metadata for your entities. This new tool provides deeper, technical information for those that want it.</p></li><li><p><strong>Q&amp;A</strong>: Any ideas on how to move existing knowledge bases to TechDocs? What do different organizations&#x27; engineering teams look like for supporting Backstage?</p></li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="watch-the-contributors-session">Watch the contributors session<a href="#watch-the-contributors-session" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Watch the contributors session" title="Direct link to Watch the contributors session">​</a></h2><youtube url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Buu_KWdIFwU" title="Backstage Community Session 13 — Adopters: February 16, 2022"></youtube><p>Highlights from this Contributors Session include:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Vote for Contributor Spotlight</strong>: Like we said before, we love our community and we want to highlight and appreciate all the invaluable work our contributors add to Backstage. So, if you know of a contributor hustling on Backstage, please <a href="https://forms.gle/8Z8UYdcU6LCcCxTg6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nominate them here</a>. Alternatively, if you want Backstage swag (and who doesn’t??) and contribute to Backstage, nominate yourself!</p></li><li><p><strong>New proposal for a TechDocs add-on framework</strong>: Spotify’s Eric Peterson, introduces us to a new proposal for a TechDocs add-on framework that encourages high quality docs, more collaboration, and improved usability. The new, proposed framework augments the default TechDocs experience with render times, accessibility features, and more. We want to make sure that your voice is heard as we continue to work on this feature, so please <a href="https://github.com/backstage/backstage/issues/9636" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">check out the RFC</a> and let us know what type of add-ons would be helpful for you!</p></li><li><p><strong>URL Reader demo</strong>: Himanshu is back at it again with a demo in this session. He walks us through his favorite core utility of Backstage – <a href="https://backstage.io/docs/plugins/url-reader#concept" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the URL Reader</a> – describes its benefits, use cases, and then ends with a demo.

But their headcount kept doubling, and before they knew it, the team had grown to 500 engineers, project managers, and designers, all in a span of a few months. Tooling was growing along with the number of people, and it was becoming difficult for anyone to figure out how things were done.

Highlights include:</p><ul><li><strong>Maintainer update on ongoing deprecations:</strong> Out with the old, in with the new. Look for more deprecations coming your way as maintainers continue to stabilize core parts of the project, particularly in the frontend plugins (core-app-api, core-plugin-api, errors, config, etc.). So make sure to read those changelogs for smoother migrations!</li><li><strong>Contributor Spotlight</strong>: Hooray for Hacktoberfest! Our contributor of the month is Colton (<a href="https://github.com/cmpadden" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@cmpadden</a>), data engineer and web developer at Georgetown University. He got started with Backstage during <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/spotify-r%26d_hacktoberfest-opensource-activity-6849722478844108800-zDT-" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hacktoberfest</a>, refactoring the Create App CLI (<a href="https://github.com/backstage/backstage/pull/7844" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#7844</a>) and improving support for TechDocs on GCS and S3 (<a href="https://github.com/backstage/backstage/pull/7554" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#7554</a>). But once he discovered how welcoming the community was, he just kept on contributing (<a href="https://github.com/backstage/backstage/commit/1578ad341b2105faed1acdf860ee7902ee56dcb2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#8096</a>: Mmm…donuts). Thanks, Colton, and welcome to the Backstage community!</li><li><strong>Future contributions to the Kubernetes plugin:</strong> Spotify’s Warp Speed squad share their ideas on what to consider when contributing to the Backstage Kubernetes plugin going forward — including updates on the team’s recent work refactoring and simplifying duplicate code, upcoming changes to Kubernetes’ main API that will soon make it easier to show resource usage in Backstage (for example, CPU/memory usage per container), adding direct links to logs regardless of cloud provider, ideas for further customization returning objects, and more. <a href="https://github.com/backstage/backstage/issues/2857" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Feedback, suggestions, and, of course, contributions are welcome!</a></li><li><strong>More advice on contributing to Backstage:</strong> Hear more thoughts on the best ways to work with the Backstage maintainers and core teams. Thinking about a big change? Raise an issue early on. Have a rough idea for something? Try writing a draft pull request sharing a little bit of code and then get feedback on whether to continue further.</li><li><strong>Updates on the Tech Insights plugin:</strong> Jussi Hallila from Roadie.io shares the latest on stage 2 of the Tech Insights plugin — including progress on <a href="https://github.com/backstage/backstage/issues/7576" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">scorecards</a>, fact retrievers, and building an MVP for displaying a “<a href="https://backstage.spotify.com/blog/measuring-backstage-success-at-spotify/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">time-to-10th pull request</a>” metric.

As a software development team at TELUS, we support that mission by building hundreds of apps and services for our customers, partners and fellow team members which can mean a lot of change. Change is good and can be exciting, but personally, I think boring is better. </p><p>As an early adopter, we’ve learned a lot and wanted to share our story alongside some important lessons we think other adopters can benefit from as they begin their Backstage journey. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="breaking-down-monoliths">Breaking down monoliths<a href="#breaking-down-monoliths" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Breaking down monoliths" title="Direct link to Breaking down monoliths">​</a></h2><p>Not only has our team of over 2,500 developers grown quickly over the past few years, we’ve also been actively breaking down multiple software monoliths. As our team grew bigger, centralized locations for tools, information, and best practices quickly fell apart and became siloed. A few years ago, we found that our developer platform — originally built as a shadow IT project — had hit its ceiling. The world had shifted in terms of developer experience best practices and we needed something new. </p><p>Our goal was to create a common touchpoint where we could evangelize better defaults so people chose our platform over one-off, siloed solutions. We wanted to enable faster builds at lower cost and create sustainable software groups through a single pane of glass that surfaced our “class A” tools: something deeply standardized (aka boring) to help everyone do their best work more efficiently lower in the stack, and freeing them up to be more interesting and innovative where it counts.</p><p>With all this in mind, we started to build our own developer portal because we couldn’t find anything that would do the job. Until we came across Backstage. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="from-backstage-to-simplify">From Backstage to Simplify<a href="#from-backstage-to-simplify" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to From Backstage to Simplify" title="Direct link to From Backstage to Simplify">​</a></h2><p>With our partner, <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thoughtworks</a>, we started exploring Backstage early in 2021. After thorough evaluation, we decided to move forward with Backstage even though the project was in the early stages. It was clear what Spotify had built felt like a true values alignment with TELUS and our vision of democratizing development. </p><p>We also really liked that Backstage was an open source project where we could pull in innovation from a growing community and contribute back in kind. It was way more appealing than paying for an off-the-shelf SaaS tool that we’d have to end up heavily customizing anyway. Adopting Backstage has been a big turning point for our open source efforts more broadly at TELUS and we’re now building an open source software contribution and consumption policy. </p><p>We opted to call our developer portal “Simplify” because that’s exactly what it needed to do for our developers. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="lessons-from-a-very-early-adopter">Lessons from a (very) early adopter<a href="#lessons-from-a-very-early-adopter" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Lessons from a (very) early adopter" title="Direct link to Lessons from a (very) early adopter">​</a></h2><p>We’ve learned a lot along the way as we’ve built out our first use case and put together the broader roadmap for Simplify. </p><ul><li><p><strong>Start narrow:</strong> You could say we took a slight deviation from the well-traveled starting point of ingesting all our components into the Software Catalog. One of our core problems was that,  in order to scale asynchronously, documentation had to be a core citizen in software. We had 80+ microsites of various quality housing technical documentations and it was very difficult to find things. Our primary audience was new joiners with metrics around making onboarding as self-serve as possible. Though we had to veer away from the TechDocs feature to get there, we’ve seen big improvements in the time-to-10th commit metric in particular. </p></li><li><p><strong>Keep your brand in mind:</strong> We struggled in that some of the design composability needs we had weren’t well-built in open source yet. TELUS has a very strong brand and to get Simplify on-brand, we had to contort the Backstage UI to meet our brand standards. Generally, we believe branding your Backstage app is an adoption best practice and recommend bringing product design resources in from the beginning to ensure you’re creating something that will build a sense of internal ownership and enthusiasm in your org. </p></li><li><p><strong>Don’t be afraid of plugins:</strong> Perhaps because we started working with Backstage <em>so early</em>, we ended up building out some custom features that — as of the 1.0 version — are no longer needed. In early 2022, we actually hit the reset button and rebuilt our implementation from the ground up to take better advantage of the current options including many plugins that didn’t exist when we started. What has been incredible is that we were able to do this reset very quickly, without losing any of the fantastic documentation we had. We are now better positioned to incorporate new plugins and even more easily contribute our plugins back to the community.</p></li></ul><p>There’s still a lot of work ahead for Simplify and we’re excited to share upcoming milestones and wins with the Backstage community.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav" aria-label="Blog list page navigation"><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--prev" href="/blog/page/2"><div class="pagination-nav__label">Newer Entries</div></a><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--next" href="/blog/page/4"><div class="pagination-nav__label">Older Entries</div></a></nav></main></div></div></div></div>
