It was a smorgasbord of some of our active community members at the first official Backstage conference — as well as some new faces interested in learning more about Backstage! To welcome us, Roadie’s <a href="https://github.com/martina-if" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Martina Iglesias Fernandez</a> and Spotify’s <a href="https://github.com/suuus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Suzanne Daniels</a> took center stage. Next up, we listened to three keynotes from the event’s top sponsors: Roadie’s <a href="https://github.com/dtuite" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">David Tuite</a> enlightened us on how to 10x developer effectiveness for teams, <a href="https://github.com/dzolotusky" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dave Zolotusky</a> from Spotify discussed developer happiness and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/spotify-r%26d_backstage-devex-activity-6990305201710587904-SnDQ?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced</a> that <a href="https://backstage.spotify.com/blog/spotify-plugins-for-backstage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spotify Plugins for Backstage</a> are launching soon, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/valentinaalaria/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Valentina Alaria</a> from VMware Tanzu talked about how to curate the Backstage experience to enable developer velocity. In between some creative snacks (lemon blueberry popcorn, anyone?) and coffee breaks, we heard from adopters including <a href="https://backstage.spotify.com/blog/building-for-simplicity-TELUS/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Telus</a>, <a href="https://backstage.spotify.com/blog/adopter-spotlight/dazn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DAZN</a>, HP, US Bank, and more on lessons learned through their adoption journeys, we talked about different ways to leverage data within Backstage, and we discussed new ways to customize Backstage for specific adopter needs.</p><p>You can watch all the BackstageCon sessions, talks, and keynotes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLj6h78yzYM2OKySsTuiip3BqmdYZQRnSf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>! </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="project-meeting-building-a-better-backstage-together">Project Meeting: Building a better Backstage together<a href="#project-meeting-building-a-better-backstage-together" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Project Meeting: Building a better Backstage together" title="Direct link to Project Meeting: Building a better Backstage together">​</a></h3><p><img loading="lazy" alt="project meeting image" src="/assets/images/real_project_meeting-9b60d996f986f124d4bbed17d1c845d5.jpeg" width="1024" height="768" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The following day, the Backstage maintainers hosted a lively project meeting, where we engaged with a lot of folks that had been at BackstageCon the day before. Over the course of the meeting, the Backstage community talked through recommended approaches for maintaining your Software Catalog as a source of truth, sourcing internal contributors for organization’s Backstage apps, improving frontend performance in a few plugins, how Backstage maintainers work, and appreciation for the contributions from our community.

They discussed how core features of Backstage are changing the way end-user developers interact and manage their ecosystem, and encouraged folks to create the future of developer experience with the rest of the Backstage community. If you missed it, no worries! Their talk track will be posted on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/cloudnativefdn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CNCF YouTube channel</a>.</p><p>…and that’s a wrap! What an incredible week. Our growing Backstage community continues to amaze us with its dedication and enthusiasm. We can’t wait to see you all again at KubeCon Europe in The Netherlands! In fact, we’d love to see our adopters give Backstage talks next year (hint, hint).

Domains are more uncertain. For example, there is confusion around whether they should be “vertical” based on a particular product that the company offers or “horizontal” based on a role that might exist in multiple teams.</li><li>People wondered if domains within domains could make sense.</li><li>People would love if dependencies between components could be worked out automatically</li><li>There was an idea to use dependencies as an information feed for Tech Insights.

Of course, this is software, so we expect things to move fast. But when you have a passionate, worldwide community building together, we’ve now seen firsthand just how fast that can be. We’re marking our second year as a community by becoming a CNCF incubating project, reaching 100 public adopters, releasing version 1.0 of the core app, and other very nice birthday gifts. Rather than a toddler finding their feet, Backstage today is beginning to look awfully grown-up for a two-year-old.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="out-of-the-sandbox-and-into-incubation">Out of the Sandbox and into Incubation<a href="#out-of-the-sandbox-and-into-incubation" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Out of the Sandbox and into Incubation" title="Direct link to Out of the Sandbox and into Incubation">​</a></h2><p>Two years ago, a small team at Spotify launched Backstage into open source during our internal Hack Week. We knew we had something special on our hands and that Backstage could potentially be the most ambitious open source project in Spotify’s history (you can listen to me wax philosophical on this topic more in <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/332yTwGiILGKTS7dsHCj2P?si=pX9xTzB2SgmsROdlLLr24A" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Episode 2 of the new NerdOut@Spotify podcast</a>.)</p><p>When Spotify donated the project to the CNCF, we saw it as the first promising step toward making Backstage an industry standard. As the home to Kubernetes, Envoy, and so many other game-changing open technologies, the CNCF and its community has had a wide-ranging impact on the daily lives of developers everywhere. And that’s what we hoped for Backstage, even back then.</p><p>But we couldn&#x27;t have envisioned where we’d be two years later — part of an ever-growing community of people that feel as passionate as we do about unlocking better developer experience for every engineering organization.</p><p>Yesterday, the CNCF announced that its <a href="https://github.com/cncf/toc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Technical Oversight Committee</a> (TOC) voted to accept Backstage as a <a href="https://www.cncf.io/blog/2022/03/15/backstage-project-joins-the-cncf-incubator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CNCF incubating project</a>. The move from the CNCF Sandbox to Incubation is an important step forward for the project’s technical governance.</p><p>It’s also recognition for all the work the Backstage open source community has done to advance and grow this project since we launched the repo on GitHub just a few weeks after that Hack Week. We still have a long way to go to becoming the standard, but moving out of the CNCF Sandbox and beginning the Incubation phase is further validation of those aspirations.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-do-retailers-gaming-studios-banks-airlines-streamers-startups-and-enterprise-software-makers-all-have-in-common">What do retailers, gaming studios, banks, airlines, streamers, startups, and enterprise software makers all have in common?<a href="#what-do-retailers-gaming-studios-banks-airlines-streamers-startups-and-enterprise-software-makers-all-have-in-common" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What do retailers, gaming studios, banks, airlines, streamers, startups, and enterprise software makers all have in common?" title="Direct link to What do retailers, gaming studios, banks, airlines, streamers, startups, and enterprise software makers all have in common?">​</a></h2><p>Developers, developers, developers — that’s what all companies have in common.

Developers who want to be able to go from idea to bug fix or feature faster.</p><p>Two years in, the Backstage ecosystem has grown by leaps and bounds. More than 5,000 contributors have joined the project and are submitting bugs, adding new features, and building valuable plugins that benefit the greater community.

We’re starting to see more and more job listings for Backstage developers which tells us that companies of all shapes and sizes are going all-in on Backstage and developer effectiveness.</p><p>Also, I’ll pause now to give a special shoutout to our early adopters. They stuck with us through all the bumps and breaking changes. But because of their early commitment, we now see instances of Backstage up and running in so many different kinds of engineering organizations.

When you think about this project in the context of the pandemic, it&#x27;s really remarkable how much this community has been able to achieve.</p><p>The Backstage community is truly global with adopters and contributors from almost every continent (sorry, Antarctica!) coming together to share what they’ve worked on and demo cool stuff in our monthly Community Sessions. The repo and the Discord server truly never sleep as a growing group of dedicated Backstage experts outside Spotify support one another and offer help 24/7.</p><p>We asked a few contributors and maintainers to share their thoughts around this two-year milestone.</p><youtube title="Backstage Turns Two!" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-j-waaybcH0"></youtube><p>Warms the heart, doesn’t it?

The <a href="https://ostif.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Open Source Technology Improvement Fund (OSTIF)</a> sponsored the audit as part of its ongoing efforts to secure the open source software ecosystem, and the audit itself was performed by <a href="https://x41-dsec.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X41 D-Sec</a>. Our goal with the audit was to evaluate and improve Backstage’s security posture, focusing on the core Backstage framework and plugins.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="report-findings-and-fixes">Report Findings and Fixes<a href="#report-findings-and-fixes" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Report Findings and Fixes" title="Direct link to Report Findings and Fixes">​</a></h2><p>The security audit and improvements concluded earlier this month, on August 18th.  The audit <strong>findings</strong> totalled two critical, two high, five medium, and three low severity vulnerabilities, alongside 15 side findings with no direct security impact. As of the <a href="https://backstage.io/docs/releases/v1.5.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Backstage 1.5 release</a>, eight out of the 12 main findings and many of the side findings are fully remedied. If you are a few versions behind there’s no need to worry though, most fixes were included in the 1.3 release.</p><p>Out of the four findings that have yet to be fixed, three are related to rate limiting or internal DoS concerns. With the introduction of the Backstage Threat Model (more on that below), Backstage’s positioning states that this is outside the scope of the security concerns of Backstage. Rather, we trust internal users of Backstage to not intentionally sabotage the availability of the service. This is not to say that we will never aim to get these findings addressed, but we have pushed them to be potential future improvements as we focus our near-term efforts on improving the product in other ways.</p><p>The last outstanding finding is to build out the capabilities of our service-to-service auth system. This is an area where the audit identified a couple of missing pieces in our early version of the implementation. We have since closed the gap by introducing token expiration, and will continue to work on this as we open up for more complex and hardened deployment patterns through the <a href="https://github.com/backstage/backstage/issues/11611" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">evolution of the backend system</a>.</p><p>Another important finding was the potential for confusion and user impersonation due to most authentication providers having sign-in enabled by default. This finding reinforced our decision to switch sign-in to being disabled by default for all authentication providers, which was part of the <a href="https://backstage.io/docs/releases/v1.1.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1.1 release</a>.</p><p>Perhaps the most important outcome of this audit is that it helped us focus our efforts to keep improving the security of Backstage. It identified priority areas in both implementation and documentation for us going forward. One particular area that was pointed out in a finding is the documentation around the security model of Backstage deployment. There have been several efforts to highlight this in documentation, but it is still not clear enough. What we’ve been lacking is documentation that is completely dedicated towards detailing the security concerns of Backstage. That is why in addition to publishing the security audit report, we are also introducing the <a href="https://backstage.io/docs/overview/threat-model" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Backstage Threat Model</a>.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="introducing-the-backstage-threat-model">Introducing the Backstage Threat Model<a href="#introducing-the-backstage-threat-model" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Introducing the Backstage Threat Model" title="Direct link to Introducing the Backstage Threat Model">​</a></h2><p>The existing Backstage documentation has many security concerns interwoven within its text, but to find them all, you need to spend a lot of time reading. We previously lacked a one-stop-shop for readers that are interested in the security model and concerns of Backstage. So, we are happy to introduce the <a href="https://backstage.io/docs/overview/threat-model" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Backstage Threat Model</a>, which closes this gap. The Threat Model outlines key security considerations for operators, developers, and security researchers. It is a living document that will evolve and expand alongside the Backstage project.</p><p>The threat model document covers the trust model and roles involved in a typical Backstage setup, the responsibilities that fall on integrators of Backstage, and common configuration concerns across all Backstage projects. Beyond these three topics, it also dives deeper into a number of core features. The <code>auth</code>, <code>catalog</code>, <code>scaffolder</code>, and <code>techdocs</code> plugins are all covered separately with their individual security concerns.</p><p>We’d like to point out a few key parts in case you are in a rush. Be sure to familiarize yourself with the integrator&#x27;s responsibility to protect the Backstage installation from unauthorized access. If you ingest organizational data into the catalog and use that to sign in users, you’ll also want to check out the first halves of the authentication and catalog sections.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="links-and-references">Links and References<a href="#links-and-references" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Links and References" title="Direct link to Links and References">​</a></h2><ul><li><a href="https://backstage.io/blog/assets/22-08-23/X41-Backstage-Audit-2022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Full Audit Report</a></li><li><a href="https://backstage.io/docs/overview/threat-model" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Backstage Threat Model</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/SECURITY.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Backstage Security Policy</a></li></ul><p>On behalf of the Backstage maintainers and community: thanks to the CNCF, OSTIF, and X41 D-Sec for the opportunity to improve the project.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/backstage-homepage-templates">Say hi to Backstage homepage templates!</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2023-07-13T12:03:52.927Z" itemprop="datePublished">July 13, 2023</time> · <!-- -->3 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><span itemprop="name">Kat Zhou &amp; Emma Indal, Spotify</span></div></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p><em>Note: This post was originally published on <a href="https://backstage.io/blog/2022/01/25/backstage-homepage-templates" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Backstage.io</a>.</em></p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="homepage template" src="/assets/images/homepage-template-blog-post-header-7a9ebc3d60195544bc7d4bbdb436554e.png" width="1200" height="600" class="img_ev3q"></p><p><em>TLDR;</em> We’re excited to announce the arrival of homepage templates for Backstage.

Most of our users start off their Backstage experience on the homepage to quickly pivot to their intended destination. For example, folks generally prefer having a search bar available for quickly finding what they are looking for. Backstage users at Spotify also prefer having a central toolkit for navigating to tools that exist within the organization and for accessing their favorite entities and documentation pages.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Backstage homepage at Spotify" src="/assets/images/spotify-backstage-homepage-459466d64fb18fa5ecb895d92e099661.png" width="1999" height="1083" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>But we also know that all organizations look different and have different needs.

Step into our daily <a href="https://discord.gg/backstage-687207715902193673" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord conversations</a> and the monthly <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMQYSTKAx0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Community Sessions</a> and you’ll find a ton of great ideas, problem-solving, and support for one another.</p><p>During one of these discussions, we realized we all shared the same pain point — upgrading a Backstage application.</p><p>The Backstage open source project is in hyper-growth mode, where dozens of pull requests are merged each day. This means adopters need to go through the upgrade process more often in order to get the latest and greatest features. The Spotify team heard a lot of feedback about how painful and manual this process was — so we decided to tackle this problem during one of our internal Hack Days.</p><p>At Spotify, we run Hack Days every month and a lot of ideas come from those sessions (in fact, the idea to open source Backstage itself <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/332yTwGiILGKTS7dsHCj2P" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">was born on a Hack Day</a>!). During a brainstorming session, we noticed that another open source community faced a similar upgrading problem years back and came up with a really good solution.</p><p>If you have ever worked on a React Native project, you might immediately recognize what we are referring to: The <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/upgrade-helper" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">React Native Upgrade Helper</a> — a web tool to support React Native developers in upgrading their apps — might have saved hours of your time. It certainly saved us hours of ours. So we looked into the project details and discovered it could fulfill our Backstage needs.</p><p>We started by creating a fork from React Native’s open source project, applying a few changes on top of it to introduce Backstage support, and — <em>ecco</em> — we had a new Backstage Upgrade Helper! In just a few days with pretty minimal effort, we created a product that would save a lot of time for the entire Backstage community. And we had fun at the same time (happy developers make happy code 😁 ).</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="so-what-is-backstage-upgrade-helper">So what is Backstage Upgrade Helper?<a href="#so-what-is-backstage-upgrade-helper" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to So what is Backstage Upgrade Helper?" title="Direct link to So what is Backstage Upgrade Helper?">​</a></h2><p>The Backstage Upgrade Helper tool enables adopters to easily upgrade their Backstage app by using the power of git to create a diff between different versions.</p><p>Whenever a new version of Backstage is released, the Helper scaffolds a new dummy Backstage app using the <code>backstage-create-app</code> cli utility and checks all the generated files in a specific git branch. After the branch is generated, it gets compared with all the existing ones, which results in generating specific git patches stored in specific files. By selecting the version of the current Backstage release together with the version you want to upgrade to, the UI knows which patch file needs to be picked up.</p><p>So, now you can update your Backstage application in three steps rather than manually reading the changelogs of all the Backstage modules in reverse order.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="to-use-the-upgrade-helper-follow-these-simple-steps">To use the Upgrade Helper, follow these simple steps<a href="#to-use-the-upgrade-helper-follow-these-simple-steps" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to To use the Upgrade Helper, follow these simple steps" title="Direct link to To use the Upgrade Helper, follow these simple steps">​</a></h3><ol><li><p>Go to the <a href="https://backstage.github.io/upgrade-helper" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Backstage Upgrade Helper</a> and enter your current release and the release you would like to upgrade to.</p></li><li><p>Press <strong>Show me how to upgrade!</strong> After that, the feature spits out the changes between the two Backstage versions in a split-screen view for easy comparison.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Backstage Upgrade Helper in action" src="/assets/images/backstage-upgrade-helper-ee80827e66fe95f734561313920d2c35.gif" width="1200" height="794" class="img_ev3q"></p></li><li><p>Apply the suggested changes to your source code to correctly upgrade your app to the selected Backstage version.

But all the credit behind this idea goes to the React Native community.</p><p>With React Native’s open source contributions, we were able to quickly solve a tough problem for the entire Backstage community. Not only did React Native’s project save us time creating a new product, but it has also saved our adopters time upgrading Backstage.</p><p>This is why we love working in open source. The hard work done for one community has the power to influence and inspire another community. We hope Backstage can do the same and pay it forward to other open source projects.</p><p>For more Backstage Upgrade Helper resources, check out the <a href="https://github.com/backstage/upgrade-helper" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UI code</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/backstage/upgrade-helper-diff" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">git patches</a>.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/authorization-framework-rfc">What’s happening with Backstage permissions and authorization</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2023-07-13T12:03:52.870Z" itemprop="datePublished">July 13, 2023</time> · <!-- -->3 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><span itemprop="name">Adam Stevenson, Spotify</span></div></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Authorization illustration showing configuration sliders and padlocks" src="/assets/images/authorization-rfc-header-71dad07b1fc9335233df2bae27ed6b3c.png" width="1201" height="631" class="img_ev3q"></p><p><strong>TL;DR</strong> The Spotify team has published an <a href="https://github.com/backstage/backstage/pull/7761" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">authorization framework RFC</a> in the Backstage GitHub repository which is open for feedback until Friday, November 5. Read on for more information about our approach and future plans for authorization.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="our-proposal-for-an-open-flexible-authorization-framework">Our proposal for an open, flexible authorization framework<a href="#our-proposal-for-an-open-flexible-authorization-framework" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Our proposal for an open, flexible authorization framework" title="Direct link to Our proposal for an open, flexible authorization framework">​</a></h2><p>With Halloween just around the corner, we thought it would be a great time to talk about something that always has admins spooked: authorization.</p><p>While Backstage adopters and contributors bring so many different perspectives and organizational challenges, authorization has emerged as a common need — even an outright blocker to adoption — frequently requested by the community.</p><p>Backstage has many different <em>authentication</em> methods, but the project currently lacks built-in ways to <em>authorize</em> access to specific data, APIs, or interface actions — these are all visible to any authenticated user.</p><p>We’ve heard Backstage adopters share a broad range of authorization requirements: implementations like role-based access control (RBAC), attribute-based access control (ABAC), bespoke logic expressed in code, or integration with external authorization providers.</p><p>Our core belief is Backstage’s power stems from its flexibility and customization, so any authorization system should allow for many different authorization mechanisms. Today we’ve published an authorization framework RFC in the Backstage GitHub repository that addresses permissions and authorization within a Backstage application, which we believe provides this flexibility. We’d love your feedback so please comment early and often — the <a href="https://github.com/backstage/backstage/pull/7761" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RFC</a> will be open until Friday, November 5.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="our-plans-for-a-spotify-built-rbac-plugin">Our plans for a Spotify-built RBAC plugin<a href="#our-plans-for-a-spotify-built-rbac-plugin" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Our plans for a Spotify-built RBAC plugin" title="Direct link to Our plans for a Spotify-built RBAC plugin">​</a></h2><p>In between exploring Swedish archipelagoes (well, some of us), the Spotify team spent the summer with community members talking about RBAC and the need to make configuration powerful yet understandable. We learned a lot and are in active development of an RBAC plugin for Backstage — which will build on the proposed authorization framework.</p><p>However, unlike previous plugin contributions, <strong>Spotify will retain ownership of our RBAC plugin and will license it under different terms</strong>. To be clear, we’re not backing away from core contributions. We believe the proposed open source authorization framework is suitable for many different permissions needs (but if you disagree, again please comment away in the RFC). We want people to build what works best for them. And we believe our RBAC solution will be a great option among other authorization mechanisms.</p><p>Our goal is to be as transparent as possible with this community so we will be sharing more details on the plugin development and distribution plan shortly.

The downside of this flexibility is that it can be hard to know where to start. Backstage can do so many things — integrating every part of your tech infrastructure and developer experience — but if you set off building a developer portal without a plan, it’s easy to get overwhelmed by all the possibilities. To help you form your plan, this post will detail how Spotify came to design our internal portal and recommend potential models for you to use when designing and building your own.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="infrastructure-as-tech-culture">Infrastructure as tech culture<a href="#infrastructure-as-tech-culture" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Infrastructure as tech culture" title="Direct link to Infrastructure as tech culture">​</a></h2><p>Before providing recommendations on getting started with Backstage, it’s helpful to have a bit of context as to why Spotify made the design decisions we did. No two companies are identical — and thus, no two Backstage implementations are the same.</p><p>Rolling back the clock just a few years, <a href="https://engineering.atspotify.com/2021/05/18/a-product-story-the-lessons-of-backstage-and-spotifys-autonomous-culture/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spotify was challenged</a> to continue to scale our engineering team (and the number of features and components built) but retain the speed of product development. Some user research with Spotify developers highlighted a clear problem: there was simply too much non-documented institutional knowledge needed to get things done. No one could find anything and everyone was interrupting everyone else trying to figure things out.</p><p>Spotify’s developers were facing three big challenges on a daily basis:</p><ul><li>They not only needed to build software quickly, they also needed to pass along knowledge to new joiners about how best to create new components.</li><li>They needed to somehow maintain a mental model of the systems their squad owned. (Or, if they were lucky, they found a hopefully-up-to-date spreadsheet tracking this information.)</li><li>They needed to keep an eye on what squads around them might be building to ensure they could reuse systems when they needed to solve similar problems in the future.</li></ul><p>In short, Spotify developers needed to continue building industry leading features at breakneck speed, while simultaneously maintaining a mental model for all the software at Spotify (oh, and help every new joiner develop that mental model as well!).</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="three-jobs-create-manage-explore">Three jobs: Create, manage, explore<a href="#three-jobs-create-manage-explore" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Three jobs: Create, manage, explore" title="Direct link to Three jobs: Create, manage, explore">​</a></h2><p>Around the same time, the <a href="https://hbr.org/2016/09/know-your-customers-jobs-to-be-done" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">jobs to be done</a> framework was becoming popular and luckily, a few Spotifiers helped guide the vision for a <em>sense-making tool for developers</em> toward using it. After user research and many failed attempts, we landed on three jobs Spotify developers needed to do consistently:</p><ul><li><strong>Create</strong>: Spotify developers want to delight their customers with incredible features. They create new software to do that.</li><li><strong>Manage</strong>: Spotify developers are proud of their work and treat their software and data like products. That requires maintaining all the software they own on an ongoing basis.</li><li><strong>Explore</strong>: Spotify developers want to solve new, yet unsolved problems. They try to build on existing systems to help them do that.</li></ul><p>So: make software, maintain the software you own throughout its lifecycle, and integrate with other people’s software.</p><p>Within today’s complex development environments, there are barriers both big and small that get in the way of those three jobs. Backstage provides the building blocks for removing those barriers, streamlining your development cycle, and letting developers do what they really want to do: build great features. Let’s take a closer look at each of these jobs.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Backstage Software Templates rocket" src="/assets/images/create-215d648acc18402a87d1608719c6fc0e.gif" width="320" height="320" class="img_ev3q"></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="create">Create<a href="#create" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Create" title="Direct link to Create">​</a></h3><p><strong>Job:</strong> You’re an engineer, ready to start building a new microservice. Do you just pick whatever framework you want? How do you reserve capacity to run your service in production? What about managing CI/CD?</p><p><strong>Tool:</strong> At Spotify, we use <strong>Backstage Software Templates</strong> to simplify all of this, reducing time–to–Hello World to just a few clicks. Instead of researching Spring Boot versus Helidon, opening a Jira ticket, rummaging through docs, and configuring CI automations, you just choose a template and your project is automatically set up in the repo for you, with the CI already running your first build.</p><p><strong>Result:</strong> By making it easier to start new projects, your engineers get to the good part of coding features faster. And your organization’s best practices are built into the templates, encouraging standards and reducing complexity in your tech ecosystem.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Backstage Service Catalog system" src="/assets/images/manage-7b2ba1637ca3b64ca5755fee13b427b7.gif" width="320" height="320" class="img_ev3q"></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="manage">Manage<a href="#manage" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Manage" title="Direct link to Manage">​</a></h3><p><strong>Job:</strong> You’re on a small team that owns a dozen services. Whenever you update and deploy those services, you’re switching between your CI, the AWS console, a security dashboard, and a CLI so you can try to figure out which Kubernetes cluster your service ended up on. In other words, you have a lot of open windows and tabs, and each step means switching to a new interface.</p><p><strong>Tool:</strong> All of your team’s software components are organized together on one page in the <strong>Backstage Service Catalog</strong>. Go to any service’s page from there and its CI/CD status, <a href="https://backstage.io/blog/2021/01/12/new-backstage-feature-kubernetes-for-service-owners" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kubernetes deployment status</a>, documentation, security checks — and everything else related to that service — is grouped together in one seamless interface that shows you only the info you want.</p><p><strong>Result</strong>: One page in Backstage has everything you need to manage the software you own. No more context-switching. No more digging through your cloud provider’s obscure admin features. Outside the repo and your IDE, everything you need to manage your service is right inside Backstage.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Backstage explorer" src="/assets/images/explore-6a463d64e28b2e845f986504acc3e9a6.gif" width="320" height="320" class="img_ev3q"></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="explore">Explore<a href="#explore" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Explore" title="Direct link to Explore">​</a></h3><p><strong>Job:</strong> You&#x27;re building a new mobile feature that needs to ensure a user is paying for the premium version of your product — but someone must’ve already built a library that handles that, right? A company-wide email and a few calls for help on Slack yield no response, so you resign yourself to building the capability yourself. Turns out someone did build the library you needed. They were just on vacation so they didn’t see your messages. How do you enable better discovery and collaboration across your org?</p><p><strong>Tools:</strong> At Spotify, anyone can find everyone else’s software — because everything is centralized inside Backstage, organized by the <strong>Backstage Service Catalog</strong> and accessible by <strong>search</strong>. Go to any library or services page, and you’ll find the owners and documentation, even its API and how to extend it if need be.</p><p><strong>Result:</strong> One place for everything, one place to search. Developers can more easily share components, build on top of each other’s work, and discover tools, libraries, frameworks, documentation, system designs, org charts, and more.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="sounds-great-where-do-i-start">Sounds great.

Where do I start?">​</a></h2><p>After talking with companies who have already adopted Backstage, we’ve seen a few common strategies for getting started. The different strategies are based on the size of your engineering org (which often also corresponds with how fast you’re growing).</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="200 engineers" src="/assets/images/200-engineers-3d654b957ad918913b1e6bb411998f43.png" width="1200" height="526" class="img_ev3q"></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="my-org-has-200-engineers-and-is-growing-fast">My org has ~200 engineers (and is growing fast)<a href="#my-org-has-200-engineers-and-is-growing-fast" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to My org has ~200 engineers (and is growing fast)" title="Direct link to My org has ~200 engineers (and is growing fast)">​</a></h3><p>You’re big enough to start feeling the pain, and only getting bigger. Onboarding and discoverability are your biggest challenges.</p><p><strong>Pain points:</strong></p><ul><li>This size seems to be the tipping point — where complexity is taking hold, collaboration starts breaking down, and ad hoc solutions stop working.</li><li>Often this is also when you’re growing so fast (doubling in size every 6–12 months) that there are now more new engineers than old engineers.</li><li>New engineers can’t find anything, so they ask around, which pulls all your other engineers off-task with interruptions.</li><li>Logjams form. One company told us how it was taking 3–4 days for pull requests to get merged.</li></ul><p><strong>Recommendation — Explore, then create:</strong></p><ul><li>New engineers need an easy way to find out how to do things, so you’re not just adding bodies, you’re adding happy, productive contributors.</li><li>To streamline onboarding, start with centralizing your documentation and making your tools and software components discoverable in Backstage.</li><li>At this size, you might not have a dedicated platform/infra team in place yet, but Backstage can provide the framework for centralizing and sharing knowledge — from managing compliance requirements to finding the right API documentation.</li><li>This allows both new and old engineers to collaborate more efficiently, easily discover best practices, and cuts down on duplicated work (e.g., a new team doesn’t end up rebuilding a database that already exists but nobody can find).</li></ul><p><img loading="lazy" alt="1,000 engineers" src="/assets/images/1000-engineers-d2f20769738c19e2c377025e76ca100d.png" width="1200" height="526" class="img_ev3q"></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="my-org-has-1000-engineers">My org has ~1,000 engineers<a href="#my-org-has-1000-engineers" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to My org has ~1,000 engineers" title="Direct link to My org has ~1,000 engineers">​</a></h3><p>You’re officially big. Lots and lots of teams are managing lots and lots of software — and the frustration of switching between all the various tools to do that is growing exponentially.</p><p><strong>Pain points:</strong></p><ul><li>Fragmentation and entropy are real threats to productivity. From security requirements to cluster management to a thousand data endpoints, there’s too much to keep track of, leading to cognitive overload.</li><li>A death by a thousand cuts: constantly logging into new interfaces — from your cloud provider’s console to some brand new security tool then back to your CI/CD — is bogging your engineers down with too much context-switching and a lot of noise.</li><li>Every day, it’s getting more and more difficult for one team to manage their own microservices, data, and documentation, let alone share their knowledge with other teams.</li></ul><p><strong>Recommendation — Manage, then explore, then create:</strong></p><ul><li>Backstage will allow your teams to get a handle on the software they own, since everything they need to manage it is in one place.</li><li>From CI/CD status to documentation to deciphering a monorepo, Backstage makes it easy to manage a service (or other software component) on a day-to-day basis.</li><li>The service catalog also helps your developers visualize your existing software ecosystem, beyond the software they own. And with Backstage Software Templates, every new software component is already added to the catalog.</li><li>Even at this scale, a small platform team should be all it takes to build and maintain your own version of Backstage. At Spotify, we have a 4-person team responsible for our internal version of Backstage, which is used by all of Spotify’s 1,600+ developers.</li></ul><p><img loading="lazy" alt="More than 1,000 engineers" src="/assets/images/1000-plus-engineers-fdd6a4f2885b03ad2267de432d330c24.png" width="1200" height="526" class="img_ev3q"></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="my-org-has-1000-engineers-1">My org has 1,000+ engineers<a href="#my-org-has-1000-engineers-1" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to My org has 1,000+ engineers" title="Direct link to My org has 1,000+ engineers">​</a></h3><p>Integrating infrastructure of this size and complexity can seem overwhelming. It’s an even bigger challenge to bring this level of change to a well-established culture with ingrained processes.</p><p><strong>Pain points:</strong></p><ul><li>When you’re this large, you’ve incorporated a lot of technology and processes, as well as a lot of partners, each with their own technologies and processes.</li><li>You’re focussed on “replacing cruft” and bringing discoverability and order to your vast ecosystem of components and tools.</li><li>Getting your tools adopted by your engineers while modernizing your tech stack and coordinating with your infra teams to improve your engineering practices across the whole company… it’s a lot.</li></ul><p><strong>Recommendation — Create, then manage, then explore:</strong></p><ul><li>The fastest way to bring change to your ecosystem is to start at the beginning of the chain with Backstage Software Templates.</li><li>With every new component created with your templates, you’re establishing best practices and rewarding your developers with a streamlined experience focused on their needs — all the while building up your new service catalog.</li><li>The more the templates ease the process of starting up a project, the more your engineers will adopt them, and the faster the other benefits of Backstage will build up, transforming productivity across your organization.
