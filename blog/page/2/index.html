We’re delighted to offer a bundle that encapsulates the plugins needed to level up your Backstage developer portal. You can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLf1KFlSkDLIA2n67Fk87svXvTi2vczEXT" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">watch our launch event</a> or just <a href="https://backstage.spotify.com/contact-us/demo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">get started with our plugins</a>.</p><p>We’re delighted to share that our <a href="https://backstage.spotify.com/plugins/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spotify Plugins for Backstage bundle subscription</a> is now available in open beta to all Backstage adopters. After years of research and iterating, we’ve created hundreds of Backstage plugins at Spotify, and this bundle of five plugins represents the very best of what we’ve built.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="unblocking-developer-experience">Un(b)locking developer experience<a href="#unblocking-developer-experience" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Un(b)locking developer experience" title="Direct link to Un(b)locking developer experience">​</a></h3><p>At Spotify, we are obsessed with how to create a better experience for our developers. Our company mission is to unlock human potential and creativity. We’ve said it before and we’ll say it again for the cheap seats in the back: Developers are creators!</p><p>Every company is a software company. So every company has to ensure their software developers are able to do their best work. At Spotify, we’ve been on a multi-year journey toward this concept of developer effectiveness, which we believe is a function of two things: productivity and happiness.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="developer effectiveness equation" src="/assets/images/Effectiveness_equation-6f0ee8333744128035205c19be9ab89a.png" width="2056" height="276" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Sure, we all want productivity. Now more than ever, we need to figure out how to do more with less. But maybe more importantly, how do you turn the spotlight on the humans in your organization and find out if they’re empowered? If their energy is being applied in healthy ways? And if they have what they need to experiment, try new things, and innovate? That’s developer satisfaction (aka happiness). We want to help you have both.</p><p>This focus on developer effectiveness has helped Spotify realize more than 10% year-over-year increases in developer productivity with employee engagement and retention rates well over industry averages. And in the three years since we open sourced the Backstage platform, we’ve spoken with hundreds of companies who are all in pursuit of the same goals.</p><p>So if you want developer effectiveness, you’re in the right place. The Spotify Plugins for Backstage bundle is the next step toward Spotify’s goal to share what we’ve learned with the world. We’re confident these plugins will take each and every developer portal built on Backstage to the next level, by making developers in your organization happier and more productive.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="level-up-your-backstage-app">Level up your Backstage app<a href="#level-up-your-backstage-app" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Level up your Backstage app" title="Direct link to Level up your Backstage app">​</a></h3><p>Don’t just take it from me: Earlier today, we hosted our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLf1KFlSkDLIA2n67Fk87svXvTi2vczEXT" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">launch event</a> where we heard directly from the Spotify plugin creators and Backstage users. At the launch, we covered how and why we built these plugins, the value they can unlock for you today, and, of course, we demoed the plugins themselves.</p><p>We also talked with adopters — <a href="https://www.telusinternational.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TELUS</a>, <a href="https://www.expediagroup.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Expedia Group</a>, <a href="https://www.boozallen.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Booz Allen Hamilton</a>, and <a href="https://www.bankofthewest.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bank of the West</a> — about how they’re addressing their own developer effectiveness goals with the Backstage platform, their experiences with the open source community, and their excitement about the Spotify Plugins for Backstage bundle.</p><p>Be sure to watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLf1KFlSkDLIA2n67Fk87svXvTi2vczEXT" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">replay</a> below or <a href="https://backstage.spotify.com/plugins" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">read more on our website</a>.</p><youtube title="Spotify Plugins for Backstage | Shipping Our Expertise" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLf1KFlSkDLIA2n67Fk87svXvTi2vczEXT"></youtube><p>As a refresher — the Spotify Plugins for Backstage bundle includes five plugins today:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://backstage.spotify.com/plugins/soundcheck" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Soundcheck</a>: Codify engineering best practices to improve quality, reliability, security, and alignment throughout your software ecosystem, all in a gamified and easy-to-use way.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://backstage.spotify.com/plugins/rbac" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Role-Based Access Control</a>: Manage access and protect your data in Backstage, flexibly and easily, to meet your organization’s evolving security and compliance needs.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://backstage.spotify.com/plugins/skill-exchange" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Skill Exchange</a>: Connect your best talent to the highest impact work through an opportunity marketplace intuitively built into Backstage.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://backstage.spotify.com/plugins/pulse" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pulse</a>: Find out how your R&amp;D teams really feel.

These plugins have been put through endless hours of internal use, iteration, and improvement. We know they work because they’ve done amazing things for us — from Soundcheck bringing test flakiness to below 1% to Skill Exchange powering thousands of collaborative hacks between teams.</p><p>We’ve also worked with a small group of customers to kick the tires on the external versions to get them they’re ready for primetime. And there’s much more to come! Our goal is to get as much feedback from the Backstage community in this open beta period and figure out how we can drive even more value for Backstage adopters.</p><p>You can get started with our plugins today by <a href="https://backstage.spotify.com/contact-us/demo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">contacting us</a> for a demo or pricing conversation.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/nerdout-at-spotify-podcast">Listen to the Backstage episodes of the NerdOut@Spotify podcast</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2023-07-13T12:03:53.385Z" itemprop="datePublished">July 13, 2023</time> · <!-- -->3 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><span itemprop="name">Jeff Feng, Spotify</span></div></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Backstage on the NerdOut@Spotify podcast" src="/assets/images/nerdout-at-spotify-podcast-backstage-a02ddfbe5a9069ab7abf16a488bf94ae.png" width="1200" height="630" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Ever wonder how Backstage got its start?

But, we believe it’s equally important to discuss what to do once you’ve made the decision to adopt Backstage. In essence, how can you gauge whether Backstage is moving the needle on improving software development processes? More importantly, how do you measure improvements to developer experience and developer effectiveness?</p><p>The answer — like most when it comes to Backstage — is there is no one-size-fits-all approach. So we’ll start with what we know and what we’ve done internally at Spotify. (In our next post, we’ll look at how our friends at Expedia Group go about it.)</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="productivity-vs-efficiency-vs-effectiveness">Productivity vs efficiency vs effectiveness<a href="#productivity-vs-efficiency-vs-effectiveness" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Productivity vs efficiency vs effectiveness" title="Direct link to Productivity vs efficiency vs effectiveness">​</a></h2><p>Let’s start with terminology. This may seem pretty basic, but software development is a human-intensive process. Much of its success hinges on a developer’s <em>productivity</em> and <em>efficiency</em>. These terms are often used interchangeably but they are actually different metrics:</p><ul><li><strong>Developer productivity</strong> is the ratio of output (i.e., the quantity of work completed) to input (i.e. effort, time). This metric is easy to measure, but it doesn’t tell the whole story.</li><li><strong>Developer efficiency</strong> is measured by the amount of resources (i.e., time, computation power, human resources) used per unit of best possible output. It accounts for all the input required, so you can see if the team is doing enough of the right kind of work.</li></ul><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Productivity = size of developed software/software development effort. Efficiency = size of developed software/resources used." src="/assets/images/productivity-vs-efficiency-b677323c132a2e6a014db532b3cb1995.png" width="1800" height="663" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>So which one do you need to track in order to determine if your development processes have improved? The answer is both, since productivity focuses on quantity and efficiency focuses on quality. You want a high quantity of output that works as intended or better.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="developer-effectiveness">Developer effectiveness<a href="#developer-effectiveness" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Developer effectiveness" title="Direct link to Developer effectiveness">​</a></h3><p>At Spotify, we also hinge a lot of our success on a third metric: <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/en-us/insights/podcasts/technology-podcasts/developer-effectiveness" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>developer effectiveness</strong></a>. If building and shipping code is a human-intensive process, effectiveness measures productivity and efficiency but also takes a qualitative look at the human beings in your org. Do people feel empowered to do their best work? Is their energy being applied in healthy ways to both their own goals and the company’s goals? Is it easy to innovate, experiment, and try new things? Effectiveness evaluates important contexts that allow your organization to address low morale, stress/burnout, and other factors that can contribute to poorer quality and high turnover in the long term.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-we-approach-metrics">How we approach metrics<a href="#how-we-approach-metrics" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How we approach metrics" title="Direct link to How we approach metrics">​</a></h2><p>So how do we measure productivity, efficiency, and effectiveness, along with other indicators that can tell you about the quality of the overall developer experience?</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="time-to-10th-pr">Time-to-10th PR<a href="#time-to-10th-pr" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Time-to-10th PR" title="Direct link to Time-to-10th PR">​</a></h3><p>Before we built Backstage in 2016, Spotify was in <a href="https://engineering.atspotify.com/2021/05/18/a-product-story-the-lessons-of-backstage-and-spotifys-autonomous-culture/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a hyper-growth period</a> and hiring engineers at a breakneck pace. But when we took a look at metrics, we saw our productivity wasn’t getting better, despite all the new hires. Specifically, when we looked at our onboarding metric — <strong>which we measure as time-to-merge your 10th pull request</strong> — we saw it had ballooned to 60 days.</p><p>As we built Backstage, our north star metric was reducing that onboarding time. And it fell quickly to less than 20 days for a new joiner to merge their 10th PR. Even though you may not be onboarding new engineers as rapidly as we were, this metric is a great proxy for the overall complexity of your ecosystem.

What the audience pays attention to from that moment on is what’s right in front of them: the performance. What we forget about (unless a light blows out or an amp malfunctions) is the team of people behind the scenes — all those technicians and artisans running around in the wings and rafters, wrangling cables, adjusting sliders, and hoisting lighting rigs — all to ensure the performance we see on stage is a great one. </p><p>When we named our internal developer portal Backstage, it felt like an apt metaphor for technology that helps power the world’s largest audio streaming service. Backstage was built to address a near-universal challenge of complexity. To abstract away the messy parts of a sprawling, fragmented tech ecosystem and give space for developers to focus on what they do best: creating. Backstage is what enables great performances from our developers.</p><p>In the nearly three years since Spotify open sourced it, Backstage has become a mature and thriving platform for companies building their own developer portals. We’re now seeing 400+ adopters and 1500+ contributors across the globe using the core framework to create better experiences for hundreds of thousands of their fellow developers. Backstage has been adopted by enterprise companies in healthcare, gaming, manufacturing, government, and more. Companies that look and feel a lot like Spotify <em>and</em> companies that don’t. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="spotify-plugins-for-backstage-a-bundle-of-productivity">Spotify Plugins for Backstage: A bundle of productivity<a href="#spotify-plugins-for-backstage-a-bundle-of-productivity" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Spotify Plugins for Backstage: A bundle of productivity" title="Direct link to Spotify Plugins for Backstage: A bundle of productivity">​</a></h3><p>Our goal has always been pretty simple: we want to make Backstage a critical part of everyday workflow to help developers everywhere be happier and more effective. That’s why Backstage is an open source platform and why Spotify is continuing to build with and support the open source community. Last year, when we <a href="https://backstage.spotify.com/blog/paid-plugins-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">first shared our intent to commercialize</a> products for Backstage, we talked about how we&#x27;ve only just begun tapping into the potential of Backstage and sharing all that it has done for us at Spotify. </p><p>Today, I’m happy to share the next step on that journey: Spotify Plugins for Backstage — a paid subscription that will soon be available to all Backstage adopters. The bundle subscription includes two kinds of plugins: (1) new external versions of some of the most popular plugins we’ve been using inside Spotify for years, and (2) plugins specifically created to unlock more value for companies using Backstage. All of these premium plugins complement the open source plugins we already provide, bringing even more of Spotify’s experience and maturity with Backstage to the platform.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="whats-in-the-bundle-subscription">What’s in the bundle subscription?<a href="#whats-in-the-bundle-subscription" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What’s in the bundle subscription?" title="Direct link to What’s in the bundle subscription?">​</a></h4><p>We’re launching with a set of plugins that address different aspects of developer experience and engineering culture. We developed this bundle with feedback from a core group of customers — and now that these versions of the plugins have been road-tested, we’ll offer beta versions to all our Backstage adopters soon (<a href="http://backstage.spotify.com/event" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">very soon!</a>). Alongside the plugins themselves, customers can expect support and services to help them get up and running when they buy the bundle.</p><p>Spotify Plugins for Backstage leverage key features of the Backstage platform: its role as a central hub for all your engineering teams where they do their everyday work, creating data-driven feedback loops between your platform teams and your feature teams to continuously strengthen and improve your internal developer community, and of course, the streamlined UX that reduces complexity and makes it so easy to use.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="meet-the-plugins">Meet the plugins<a href="#meet-the-plugins" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Meet the plugins" title="Direct link to Meet the plugins">​</a></h4><p>Spotify Plugins for Backstage are aimed at solving common development challenges, reducing operational toil, encouraging best practices, and improving collaboration, transparency, and learning throughout your engineering org — you know, all those things that pave the way for happier developers and happier code. Here are the plugins that will be available in the bundle.</p><p><strong>Soundcheck:</strong> See how well your components measure up to engineering best practices and standards at a glance. When owners can easily see the tech health of their components, it incentivizes quality, reliability, and alignment throughout your software ecosystem. The Soundcheck plugin visualizes checks for security, testing, reliability, and other development and operational standards. And seeing leads to doing. So instead of asking your developers to file and respond to yet another ticket, promote software quality through clear scorecards, actionable feedback, and positive reinforcement.</p><p><strong>RBAC:</strong> Manage access and protect your data in Backstage, flexibly and easily. Role-based access control (RBAC) should be as easy to manage as possible — because the simpler it is to do, the better protected your data will be. Built on top of the open source permissions framework for Backstage, our RBAC plugin provides a no-code management UI for restricting access to plugins, routes, and data within your developer portal. With its intuitive interface, admins can quickly define roles, assign users and groups, and configure permissions to encode authorization decisions according to your organization’s evolving security and compliance needs.</p><p><strong>Skill Exchange:</strong> Share expertise across your org by creating an internal marketplace for on-the-job learning opportunities and promoting a culture of self-led growth. Talent, knowledge, and experience can often get trapped inside organizational silos. With the Skill Exchange plugin, now your R&amp;D community can unlock opportunities for collaboration and meaningful connection, no matter where anyone sits in the org chart. Mentors can connect with mentees, teams can connect with temporary help, developers can pair up to program together, and ad hoc teams can assemble to work on hack projects.</p><p>By making it easier for your developers to discover and borrow each other’s skills, both teams and individuals can learn, grow, and stretch their abilities together — leading to happier, more fulfilled, and more capable devs — no orientation required.</p><p><strong>Pulse:</strong> Find out how your R&amp;D teams really feel. Pulse is an R&amp;D survey framework that lets you track key productivity and satisfaction metrics, analyze the anonymized response data to discover trends, and visualize those insights (all within Backstage). Pulse focuses on the concerns of developers and other members of your tech community, telling you everything general HR surveys can’t — from what your data scientists think about your workflow tooling to the most common blockers teams say they’re facing.</p><p>By helping you quantify developer satisfaction and effectiveness, the Pulse plugin allows you to collect the data you need to drive continuous improvements to your R&amp;D tooling, processes, and culture — and ship code faster.</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong> Surveys are great for capturing how your people feel. But you also want to know how they’re actually behaving. The Insights plugin is your window into Backstage usage at your organization. It captures and displays key data points, including your daily active Backstage users and most commonly used plugins. With the Insights plugin, you can measure Backstage adoption, understand user behavior, and identify trends. Knowing how your teams are using Backstage today helps you meet the demands of tomorrow.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-is-spotify-selling-plugins">Why is Spotify selling plugins?<a href="#why-is-spotify-selling-plugins" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why is Spotify selling plugins?" title="Direct link to Why is Spotify selling plugins?">​</a></h3><p>We love a freemium business model here at Spotify. Our investment with Backstage is following suit with our consumer offerings — in this case, the subscription is meant to enhance what’s available in open source. The overarching question we asked when developing these plugins was, “Will this make Backstage more useful and powerful for open source adopters?” And that’s the question we’ll continue to ask as we evolve the subscription. </p><p>We hope that by adding paid plugins from Spotify to the other commercial services surrounding Backstage, the platform becomes more valuable to current adopters, we’ll broaden its reach to new adopters, and we’ll create a more diverse ecosystem for the community at large.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="sustaining-the-platform-and-the-community">Sustaining the platform and the community<a href="#sustaining-the-platform-and-the-community" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Sustaining the platform and the community" title="Direct link to Sustaining the platform and the community">​</a></h4><p>The bundle subscription is also how we see Spotify continuing to sustain its investment in Backstage. Revenue generated from the bundle can be reinvested into developing and releasing more plugins — including more of the 200+ plugins we use internally — and evolving Backstage further. We see this is a good thing for our community, for our teams, and our customers.</p><p>But to be clear: Spotify is not moving away from open source contributions or the Backstage project community. Instead, we’re doubling down on Backstage, and the bundle subscription enables Spotify to continue to grow our investment in the open source project and community.</p><p>A core part of our company mission is to unlock human potential and creativity.

It will tell the story of how Spotify created a service catalog to bring order to thousands of microservices. It grew to become Backstage, an internal developer portal supporting not just services, but also machine learning models, documentation, over 9000 data pipelines, and much more. With 115 plugins contributed by 58 different teams, Backstage is now Spotify’s single pane of glass for the entire engineering organization. In 2020 Backstage and its software catalog was open sourced and donated to the CNCF, making it available for everyone to use. The talk will also walk you through strategies for adopting Backstage in an existing organization, and how to bootstrap your own catalog.</p></blockquote></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/introducing-backstage-learn">Knowledge is power: Introducing Backstage Learn</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2023-07-13T12:03:53.265Z" itemprop="datePublished">July 13, 2023</time> · <!-- -->3 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><span itemprop="name">Emma White, Spotify</span></div></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Learn blog post header image" src="/assets/images/learnanimation-9195669fe88e4639379f765c5a03400e.gif" width="1200" height="630" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Heard about Backstage but don’t know where to begin?

Spoiler alert: It makes all three better!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-backstage-translates-to-quantifiable-impact">How Backstage translates to quantifiable impact<a href="#how-backstage-translates-to-quantifiable-impact" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How Backstage translates to quantifiable impact" title="Direct link to How Backstage translates to quantifiable impact">​</a></h2><p>At Spotify, we get a lot of questions around Backstage and the value it can give to organizations, and rightly so. We talk about how Backstage makes developers happier and more productive, but what does that actually mean in practice? A couple years ago, we <a href="https://backstage.spotify.com/blog/measuring-backstage-success-at-spotify/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">published a blog</a> detailing how we measure Backstage success at Spotify. This blog highlighted proxy metrics to gauge things we care about moving the needle on like time-to-tenth-PR, number of plugins contributed, satisfaction rates, etc.</p><p>But this time around, we wanted to share metrics that we believe affect a business’ bottom line through a clear return on investment: developer activity, development lifecycle, and developer retention. And we found some pretty cool stuff…</p><p>At Spotify, we see frequent Backstage users:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="roidata" src="/assets/images/roidata-ee9fddddfa6162b54047645147aecef0.png" width="1667" height="523" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>That’s a lot! So let’s unpack all of these stats a bit.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="spotify-devs-do-better-with-backstage">Spotify devs do better with Backstage<a href="#spotify-devs-do-better-with-backstage" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Spotify devs do better with Backstage" title="Direct link to Spotify devs do better with Backstage">​</a></h2><p>Before we get too deep into the findings, let’s talk about  our methodology for this analysis. Michael Bellato, Senior Data Scientist at Spotify, observed Backstage activity for the first half of 2022 for developers. After observing that group, he measured developer activities, retention, and satisfaction for the same group for the next 6 months to a year. For simplicity, this pre-post approach in our analysis does not account for potential seasonality effects. As well, given the level of adoption for Backstage within Spotify with our internal developer community, there was no possibility to carry out our analysis by using a control group of non Backstage users. We therefore used observational methods to determine Backstage’s value and grouped users into 2 categories: frequent and less frequent users. In order to ensure both groups of users were as comparable as possible, we then controlled and matched factors such as their tenure (in number of weeks) and work mode (i.e. office or remote).</p><p>Now onto the findings! At Spotify, we believe that Backstage improves developer effectiveness, which is a function of satisfaction and productivity. So we set out to quantify what these terms mean in practice for us. For satisfaction, we felt that retention was a good indicator of how a developer’s happiness or satisfaction at a company affects the bottom line. For productivity, we looked at developer output and speed. Lastly, we found what Backstage means for the longevity of a developer’s output. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="productivity">Productivity<a href="#productivity" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Productivity" title="Direct link to Productivity">​</a></h3><p>There are so many ways to quantify productivity. Through user research we have discovered that Backstage increases productivity through the ability to find, understand, and take action on information; in general, organizations find they are able to do more with less. With consideration to these findings, we have focused this research on productivity as developer output and speed.</p><p>First, we found that developers that use Backstage more often have 2.3x more developer activity in GitHub in the following six months than the bottom Backstage users. From our internal developer survey that we send out every quarter we also noticed that developers that are more active have higher ratings of their perceived productivity (Psst! If you’re interested in setting up your own survey in Backstage, check out <a href="https://backstage.spotify.com/plugins/pulse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pulse</a>).</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="graph showing more github activity for frequent backstage users" src="/assets/images/graph1-a02e02eee4c009e3d7b97e47e765c5c1.png" width="1000" height="800" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>We also saw that frequent Backstage users create over 2x more code changes than infrequent Backstage users. On top of that, these code changes take 17% less cycle time for more frequent Backstage users.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="graph showing more code changes for people that use backstage frequently" src="/assets/images/graph2-fcb0296b687164fd60dfd34b578151ac.png" width="1000" height="800" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>When we combined the reduced cycle time with increased PR activity, we found that this had an effect of saving 3 full time employees (FTEs) for a team of 10 developers.  Developers that are more productive in less time, save time and resources for an engineering organization.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="development-lifecycle-and-speed">Development lifecycle and speed<a href="#development-lifecycle-and-speed" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Development lifecycle and speed" title="Direct link to Development lifecycle and speed">​</a></h3><p>But what does speed matter if you’re not able to ensure improvements in the overall development lifecycle? When your developers deploy new software, you want to ensure it meets standards and you don’t have to change or deprecate it in short order. From user research we found that Backstage’s flexibility enables organizations to address a wide range of needs in a wide range of contexts, thus adding efficiencies to existing capabilities. These efficiencies are what we have been able to confirm at Spotify with the adoption of Backstage throughout the different stages of the development lifecycle; evidenced with the productivity improvements measured in our most recent analysis. At Spotify, we found that high frequency Backstage users deploy software to production 2x as often and their software stays deployed 3x as long. We believe that higher rates of deployments to production and their increased longevity are indications of higher code quality, as well as increased developer speed and productivity.

For a team of 100 developers, this is an increase in five FTEs. Keeping your developers happy matters.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="graph showing spotify retention affected by backstage" src="/assets/images/graph4-00e268b6c53f8bd749701e1433b6a4cc.png" width="1000" height="800" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Conclusion" title="Direct link to Conclusion">​</a></h2><p>At Spotify, high frequency Backstage users deploy software more often in less time.

Is it by measuring something arbitrary, like how many lines of code they’ve written or how many commits they’ve made? Nope. How much useful data are you really getting out of those numbers anyway?</p><p>Instead, it’s more helpful to think of performance in terms of “developer effectiveness”. Suddenly, it’s not about the quantity of work and time spent, but the quality. Are engineers wasting a bunch of their days just trying to find what they need to get started, or are they able to jump straight into the work they really want to do with as few blockers as possible?</p><p>Pia Nilsson, Director of Engineering and Head of Platform Developer Experience at Spotify, addressed these and other questions on the <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/podcasts/technology-podcasts/developer-effectiveness" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thoughtworks podcast</a>: What types of problems do Spotify engineers face? And why did we create <a href="https://backstage.spotify.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Backstage</a> to address those issues? Read on to find out how exactly Backstage helped us, and how you can use Backstage to boost the effectiveness of your own team.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="growing-pains">Growing pains<a href="#growing-pains" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Growing pains" title="Direct link to Growing pains">​</a></h2><p>As Pia explains in the podcast, when she started at Spotify in 2016, we were facing an interesting problem. We were in the middle of a hiring boom during a period of exponential growth. From the outside, everything seemed to be moving along swimmingly. But internally, a few metrics were giving us pause; specifically, our productivity wasn’t increasing at all, even with all the new hires.</p><p>So we did what we always do: we looked at the data. We had a few metrics for determining and monitoring developer effectiveness — deployment frequency, for instance — but the most crucial was our onboarding metric. You see, we gauge how well our onboarding process is working by measuring how long it takes for a new engineer to make their tenth pull request. And in the midst of our hiring frenzy, that number was getting incredibly high: over 60 days. Clearly something had to be done, but what were the issues developers were facing to begin with?</p><p>Pia and her team looked into the issue, and this was the feedback she got back from the engineers, in her own words:</p><ol><li><p>“First, it was the context switching … because we had a very fragmented ecosystem. Why did we have a fragmented ecosystem? … Every single team is like a little startup, and it’s free to charge ahead and reach their mission by themselves … This is very conducive for speed, but when we grow, that’s where stuff starts to break down. Of course, this leads to a lot of cognitive load for our engineers.”</p></li><li><p>“The number two blocker was that it’s just hard to find things. Which service should I be integrating with as an engineer? Should I use the user data service that the customer service team has built? Or should I use the slightly different user data service that the premium team has built? Or should I just go ahead and build my own? This, of course, leads to further fragmentation, and we’re back to problem number one.”</p></li></ol><p>Considering both of these challenges, it’s clear that as Spotify grew, our famously autonomous culture was also driving our working environment to become increasingly convoluted and disparate. No one was on the same page, and it was starting to weigh us down. The obvious solution, of course, would be to mandate our engineers use the same technologies and microservices so that we started acting more as a monolith.</p><p>But that just wouldn’t fly at Spotify. Again, our autonomous culture, and all the freedom that comes with it, was a big reason a lot of people liked working at Spotify to begin with. It’s key to our identity. Mandating our problems away was out of the question.</p><p>What else could we do? What we needed was a solution that prioritized developers and their ways of working. What we needed was a place where everyone could go to find everything they needed, no matter what it was. What we needed was Backstage.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="backstage-a-platform-for-your-platforms">Backstage: a platform for your platforms<a href="#backstage-a-platform-for-your-platforms" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Backstage: a platform for your platforms" title="Direct link to Backstage: a platform for your platforms">​</a></h2><p>As Pia notes, Spotify developed <a href="https://engineering.atspotify.com/2020/03/17/what-the-heck-is-backstage-anyway/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Backstage</a> to help our engineers do three different things: find stuff, manage stuff, and create stuff. In other words, it’s built to address all the blockers our engineers were facing, especially in terms of discoverability.</p><p>Where our engineers used to spend hours of their week just looking for things — documentation, platforms, systems and their owners — all over the internet, now they can find everything in one place: Backstage. Similarly, rather than moving from tab to tab, checking to see the health of, say, their Kubernetes clusters or the status of their recent deployment, engineers can now use Backstage to bring together monitoring tools, logging, their CI/CD pipeline, and whatever else our engineers needed to manage.</p><p>Now, let’s say our engineers want to spin up a new ML model, data pipeline, or some other component or microservice. Rather than building something on their own, introducing yet another instance of boilerplate code similar to a dozen others in our ecosystem, they can now use Backstage to do that work for them. Not only does this save them time if they choose to do this, but these new components and services are also set up using our own best practices and tech standards — what we call our <a href="https://engineering.atspotify.com/2020/08/17/how-we-use-golden-paths-to-solve-fragmentation-in-our-software-ecosystem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Golden Paths</a>.</p><p>Because of this, we’re able to have our cake and eat it too. Our engineers and squads can remain entirely autonomous, even as Backstage nudges them toward walking down these Golden Paths, thereby increasing our teams’ alignment and keeping our ecosystem from becoming more fragmented. Additionally, because <a href="https://github.com/backstage/backstage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Backstage is a rapidly growing open source tool</a>, more and more features and plugins are constantly being added for a variety of use cases beyond the ones mentioned here.</p><p>So, with all that being said, was Backstage worth all the time and money we invested into it? Well, let’s go back to the onboarding metrics one more time. Remember when Pia discovered that it took over 60 days for onboarding engineers to merge their tenth pull request? After Backstage was introduced, that number dropped to only 20. “And if you have numbers like that in your organization,” mentions Pia, “I find that it’s easy to get buy-in for investments in developer experience.”</p><p>Interested in hearing more about Backstage and what it can do for you?

At this point, we’ve spoken with hundreds of companies at various stages in their Backstage journey. Those conversations run the gamut but most often the question we hear is, <a href="https://backstage.io/blog/2021/05/20/adopting-backstage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“How do I get started with Backstage?”</a></p><p>If you’ve been asking yourself the same thing, the good news is: you’re not the first and you’re not alone. Backstage is still new, but we’ve now crossed over 18 months with the project in the wild. And we’ve learned a ton: how unique each organization’s needs are, when flexibility and customization can lead to paralysis, and where teams have found quick wins in building better developer experience.</p><p>So if you’re curious about how to get started with Backstage, <a href="https://info.backstage.spotify.com/office-hours" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">give us a shout</a> and book a one-to-one meeting. Given our 5+ years of experience as the original adopter, the Spotify team brings a lot of lessons learned and perspective on how to position the investment needed to bring a developer portal to life.</p><p>We’re also happy to connect you with <a href="https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/ADOPTERS.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">other adopters</a> in the community. We’ve found other organizations are eager to share knowledge, experience, and best practices around adoption.
In addition, our <a href="https://github.com/backstage/community/tree/main/backstage-community-sessions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">monthly community sessions</a> and <a href="https://info.backstage.spotify.com/newsletter_subscribe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">newsletter</a>, <a href="https://discord.com/channels/687207715902193673/687207715902193679" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">very active Discord channel</a> and <a href="https://backstage.io/docs/overview/roadmap" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">quarterly roadmap</a> are great ways to keep up with what’s happening in Backstage.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="get-help-from-our-partners">Get help from our partners<a href="#get-help-from-our-partners" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Get help from our partners" title="Direct link to Get help from our partners">​</a></h2><p>We get it that at times your consulting needs will be more hands-on — from project scoping to activation to onboarding your dev teams. That’s why we’ve partnered with service providers who can help build out a fully customized Backstage solution tailored to your organization’s needs.</p><p>How does our partner program work? We vet potential partners on whether they’re equipped to provide a successful Backstage implementation (as well as their overall service delivery capabilities, reputation in the market, etc.), set up a referral agreement with contracted partners we trust, and send adopters their way when it&#x27;s a best fit.</p><p>For instance, <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/about-us/news/2021/thoughtworks-is-collaborating-with-spotify-to-deliver-better-dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">we’ve partnered with Thoughtworks</a>, a leading global technology consultancy, for full-scale developer portal activations. Thoughtworks has been on the ground floor with customers like TELUS Digital (Canada’s largest telecom) looking to support and streamline their developer experience using Backstage.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="lets-get-started">Let’s get started<a href="#lets-get-started" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Let’s get started" title="Direct link to Let’s get started">​</a></h2><p>So whether you’re just looking for tips and advice, or more hands-on help getting Backstage up and running, <a href="https://info.backstage.spotify.com/office-hours" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">contact us</a> and we can connect you with a partner — or just share what we’ve learned from other adopters.
