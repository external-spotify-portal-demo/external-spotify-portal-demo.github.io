The Source Control Management (SCM) integration plugin for
[Soundcheck](https://backstage.spotify.com/plugins/soundcheck/) enables integration with the following source
control management providers:

- azure
- bitbucketCloud
- bitbucketServer
- gerrit
- gitea
- github
- gitlab

## Prerequisites

### SCM Integrations - Connecting the SCM module to SCM providers

To connect to external providers, an 'integration' must be provided in the main `app-config.yaml` file
as follows:

```yaml
integrations:
  github:
    - host: github.com
      token: ${GITHUB_TOKEN}
```

The above example provides a GitHub integration, with the `host` set to `github.com`. Authentication is provided
via a token issued from `github.com` for the repository that you'd like to connect to.

Consult the [Backstage GitHub integration instructions](https://backstage.io/docs/integrations/github/locations) for full configuration details.

### Add the ScmFactCollector to Soundcheck

Source Control Management integration for Soundcheck is not installed by default. It must be manually installed and configured.

First, add the `@spotify/backstage-plugin-soundcheck-backend-module-scm` package:

```bash
yarn workspace backend add @spotify/backstage-plugin-soundcheck-backend-module-scm
```

Then, in `packages/backend/src/plugins/soundcheck.ts`, add the `ScmHubFactCollector`:

```diff
  import { SoundcheckBuilder } from '@spotify/backstage-plugin-soundcheck-backend';
  import { Router } from 'express';
  import { PluginEnvironment } from '../types';
+ import { ScmFactCollector } from '@spotify/backstage-plugin-soundcheck-backend-module-scm';

  export default async function createPlugin(
    env: PluginEnvironment,
  ): Promise<Router> {
    return SoundcheckBuilder.create({ ...env })
+     .addFactCollectors(
+       ScmFactCollector.create(env.config, env.logger),
+     )
      .build();
  }
```

Consult the the [Soundcheck Backend documentation](https://spotify.github.io/spotify-for-backstage-docs/soundcheck/setup-and-installation#backend-setup) for additional details on setting up the Soundcheck backend.

### Adding SCM Entities

To use Source Control Management (SCM) integrations, an entity hosted by an SCM provider is needed.
As an example, an entity could be added to the catalog with a `type` set to `url` and a `target` set to the entity's hosted location, like so:

```yaml
catalog:
  locations:
    # Soundcheck external demo
    - type: url # Denotes SCM entities.
      target: https://github.com/your_repo/blob/main/all-components.yaml
```

The configuration above adds a component hosted by `github.com` and configured by the target `yaml`
file.

## Configuring the SCM Module

The facts to be collected by the Source Control Management (SCM) module must be defined in one or more `yaml` files, and then
referenced in the Soundcheck configuration in the `app-config.yaml` file, like so:

```yaml
soundcheck:
  collectors:
    scm:
      - $include: ./scm-fact-extraction-configurations.yaml
      - $include: ./more-scm-fact-extraction-configurations.yaml
      - $include: ./even-more-scm-fact-extraction-configurations.yaml
```

With an [SCM entity in your catalog](#adding-scm-entities), an [SCM integration](#scm-integrations---connecting-the-scm-module-to-scm-providers) set, and SCM
configuration files added to the `soundcheck.collectors.scm` field, your Backstage instance is almost ready to extract facts from SCM providers.

The next section covers how to set up the fact extraction configuration files to extract facts from
SCM.

## SCM Fact Extraction Configuration

The **SCM Fact Collector** configuration `yaml` files have the following structure:

```yaml
frequency:
  cron: '0 * * * *' # Defines a schedule for when the facts defined in this file should be collected
  # This is optional and if omitted, facts will only be collected on demand.
filter: # A filter specifying which entities to collect the specified facts for
  kind: 'Component'
cache: # Defines if the collected facts should be cached, and if so for how long
  duration:
    hours: 2
collects: # An array of fact extractor configuration describing how to collect SCM facts.
  - SCM Fact Extractor Configuration One
  - SCM Fact Extractor Configuration Two
  - ...
  - SCM Fact Extractor Configuration N
```

Below are the details for each field.

#### `frequency` [Optional]

The frequency at which the collector should be executed. Possible values are either a cron expression `{ cron: ... }` or [HumanDuration](https://backstage.io/docs/reference/backend-tasks.humanduration).
This is the default frequency for each extractor.

#### `filter` [Optional]

A filter specifying which entities to collect the specified facts for. Matches the [filter format](https://backstage.io/docs/reference/catalog-client.entityfilterquery) used by the Catalog API.
This is the default filter for each extractor.

#### `cache` [Optional]

If the collected facts should be cached, and if so for how long. Possible values are either `true` or `false` or a nested `{ duration:` [HumanDuration](https://backstage.io/docs/reference/types.humanduration) `}` field.
This is the default cache config for each extractor.

#### `collects`

An array of SCM Fact Extractor configurations describing how to collect SCM facts. See the section
below for details on configuring the extractors.

## SCM Fact Extractors

The [Exists](#exists-fact-extractor), [RegEx](#regex-fact-extractor), and [JSON/YAML](#jsonyaml-fact-extractor) Source Control Management (SCM) fact extractor configurations are described in detail below. Before going into the detailed schemas of the individual fact extractors, the base schema that they all share will be covered first.

### Common Fact Extractor Schema

All **SCM Fact Extractors** share a common base schema, the variables for which are defined below:

#### `factName`

The name of the fact to be extracted.

- Minimum length of 1
- Maximum length of 100
- Alphanumeric with single separator instances of periods, dashes, underscores, or forward slashes

#### `filter` [Optional]

A filter specifying which entities to collect the specified facts for. Matches the [filter format](https://backstage.io/docs/reference/catalog-client.entityfilterquery) used by the Catalog API.
If provided, it overrides the default filter provided at the top level. If not provided, it defaults to the filter provided at the top level. If neither extractor's filter, nor default filter is provided, the fact will be collected for all entities.

#### `cache` [Optional]

If the collected facts should be cached, and if so for how long. Possible values are either `true` or `false` or a nested `{ duration:` [HumanDuration](https://backstage.io/docs/reference/types.humanduration) `}` field.
If provided, it overrides the default cache config provided at the top level. If not provided, it defaults to the cache config provided at the top level. If neither extractor's cache, nor default cache config is provided, the fact will not be cached.
Example:

```yaml
cache:
  duration:
    hours: 24
```

#### `frequency` [optional]

The frequency at which the fact extraction should be executed. Possible values are either a cron expression `{ cron: ... }` or [HumanDuration](https://backstage.io/docs/reference/backend-tasks.humanduration).
If provided, it overrides the default frequency provided at the top level. If not provided, it defaults to the frequency provided at the top level. If neither extractor's frequency, nor default frequency is provided, the fact will only be collected on demand.

Example:

```yaml
frequency:
  minutes: 10
```

#### `branch` [optional]

The branch to extract the fact from. If not provided, defaults to the repository's default branch.

### Exists Fact Extractor

The Exists Fact Extractor collects information on whether a given set of files exists in
the SCM provider. The extensions to the base schema are as follows:

#### `type`

Must be exactly `exists`, like so:

```yaml
type: exists
```

#### `data`

The data collected for this fact. This is an array consisting of two pairs of `name` and `path`:

- `name`: An identifier for the data element.
- `path`: The path to the file.

Both `name` and `path` are subject to the naming restrictions of [factName](#factname).

#### Sample Exists Configuration

Here's a sample `yaml` configuration for a fact that gets information on the
existence of two files, `README.md` and `catalog-info.yaml`:

```yaml
collects:
  - factName:
      readme_and_catalog_info_files_exist_fact # This gives this fact an identifier which is
      # used to refer to the fact in other
      # configuration files.
    type: exists # This identifies the type of fact to collect.
    data: # This defines the data element which will be returned in the
      # fact object when the fact is collected.
      - name: readme_exists # Label for the data element.
        path: /README.md # The file for which existence will be determined.
      - name: catalog_info_exists # Label for the data element.
        path: /catalog-info.yaml # The file for which existence will be determined.
    filter: # A filter to narrow the applicability of this fact.
      metadata.name:
        soundcheck-external-demo # This filter makes this fact applicable only to the
        # component with the given name, in this case
        # 'soundcheck-external-demo'
```

The checks that will compare the data collected by this fact to the expected outcomes is specified
in the `app-config.yaml` file. Since this fact collects two data elements, there will be
two checks that check the value of each data element. The two checks would look like this:

```yaml
soundcheck:
  checks:
    - id: has_readme_check # The name of the check
      rule: # How to evaluate this check
        factRef: scm:default/readme_and_catalog_info_files_exist_fact # The fact data to reference
        path: $.readme_exists # The path to the field to analyze
        operator: equal # Indicates the operation to apply
        value: true # The desired value of the field indicated in path, above.
    - id: has_catalog_info_file_check
      rule:
        factRef: scm:default/readme_and_catalog_info_files_exist_fact
        path: $.catalog_info_exists
        operator: equal
        value: true
```

Finally, these two checks need to be listed in a program level `ordinal` within the `soundcheck-programs.yaml` file. Here's an example:

```yaml
- id: demo
  name: Demo
  ownerEntityRef: group:default/owning_group
  description: >
    Demonstration of Soundcheck Exists Fact Extractor
  levels:
    - ordinal: 1
      name: First level
      description: Checks leveraging Soundcheck's SCM Exists Fact Extractor
      checks:
        - id: has_catalog_info_file_check # The identifier for the check.
          name: Has catalog-info.yaml # A human-readable name for this check
          description:
            > # The description to display on the Soundcheck page for this check.
            Repositories should contain a catalog-info.yaml file.
        - id: has_readme_check
          name: Has README.md
          description: |
            Repositories should provide a README.md file at root.
```

### RegEx Fact Extractor

The RegEx Fact Extractor collects information about the contents of a file. Two modes are supported:

- [True/False Mode](#truefalse-mode)
- [RegEx Capture Groups Mode](#regex-capture-groups-mode)

###### True/False Mode

True/False Mode uses a RegEx, or Regular Expression, to search for a match in a specified file. If a RegEx
match is found, the resulting fact data will contain a value of `true` for a field named `matches`. If not, the
`matches` field will contain a value of `false`.

###### RegEx Capture Groups Mode

Using RegEx Capture Groups Mode allows the extractor to associate capture groups within a RegEx
to named values. This allows checks to verify that the captured values are correct.

#### RegEx Fact Extractor Schema

The extension schema for RegEx Fact Extractors is as follows:

#### `type`

Must be exactly `regex`, like so:

```yaml
type: regex
```

#### `path`

The path to the file to analyze.

#### `regex`

A valid RegEx string. This string is used on the file to collect data elements or to provide a `true`/`false` response corresponding to whether there is a match for the RegEx or not in the file.

#### `data` [Optional]

Defines the data to collect for this fact. This is an array consisting of two pairs of `name` and
`type`:

- `name`: An identifier for the data element. Subject to the naming restrictions of
  [factName](#factname).
- `type`: The expected type of data to be collected.

Each pair defined in the data field _must_ correspond to a capture group in the given `regex`. A mismatch between data element definition counts and RegEx Capture Groups is an error. Fact
data will not be collected. 

If the data element is not present, the mode of the RegEx Fact Extractor defaults to [True/False Mode](#truefalse-mode).

#### Sample RegEx Configuration

The `yaml` below defines both modes of the RegEx Extractor, [True/False Mode](#truefalse-mode) and [RegEx Capture Groups Mode](#regex-capture-groups-mode).

Sample fact definitions are as follows:

```yaml
collects:
  - factName: apache_license_fact # Name of the fact
    type: regex # Type of the fact
    path: /LICENSE.md # Path to the file whose contents will be searched
    regex: .*Apache License.*Version 2\.0.* # Regex to match.
    # Note lack of any 'data:' object definition, this implies this regex is a true/false type.

  - factName: api_version_fact
    type: regex
    path: /catalog-info.yaml
    regex:
      '^apiVersion: backstage.io/(.+)' # Note the capture group! Each capture group in a regex
      # *must* correspond to a named data element, see below.
    data: # Data describing each capture group
      - name: captured_api_version # The name of the first capture group
        type: string # The type of the first capture group.
```

With fact collection specified, we must now define checks against the data that will be collected
for each fact. We define the checks in the `app-config.yaml` file. Here are sample checks that correspond to
the RegEx facts above:

```yaml
soundcheck:
  checks:
    - id: uses_recommended_license_check # ID for this check
      rule: # How to evaluate this check
        factRef: scm:default/apache_license_fact # The fact data to reference
        path:
          $.matches # The path to the field to analyze, note that this is always 'matches' for a
          # true/false type regex.
        operator: equal # Indicates the operation to apply
        value:
          true # The desired value of path field, above. True here indicates
          # that, indeed, we want to have found the 2.0 apache license version in the
          # given file.

    - id: api_version_check
      rule:
        factRef: scm:default/api_version_fact
        path:
          $.captured_api_version # This path refers to the name given to the capture group in
          # the fact definition.
        operator: equal
        value:
          v1alpha1 # This is the value we expect to have captured via the regex for this
          # capture group. This can be any string.
```

Finally, the checks defined above must be present in the `soundcheck-programs.yaml` file under an appropriate program level `ordinal` of a program. Here's an example:

```yaml
---
- id: demo
  name: Demo
  ownerEntityRef: group:default/owning_group
  description: >
    Demonstration of Soundcheck Regex Fact Extractor
  levels:
    - ordinal: 1
      name: First level
      description: Checks leveraging Soundcheck's SCM Regex Fact Extractor
      checks:
        - id: uses_recommended_license_check # Check ID to include
          name: Uses Apache License 2.0 # Human-readable name for this check.
          description: |
            Use of the Apache License 2.0 is required.
        - id: api_version_check
          name: Has correct API version
          description: >
            "Ensures that the component is using the correct api version, which is
            v1alpha1".
```

### JSON/YAML Fact Extractor

The final fact extractor type supported by the Source Control Management (SCM) plugin is the JSON/YAML Fact Extractor. It works similarly to the [RegEx Fact Extractor](#regex-fact-extractor) in that it extracts `json`/`yaml` values from a file for use in checks.

#### JSON/YAML Fact Extractor Schema

The extension schema for JSON/YAML Fact Extractors is as follows:

#### `type`

Must be one of `json` or `yaml`, like so:

```yaml
type: json
```

#### `path`

The path to the file to analyze.

#### `data`

Defines the data to collect for this fact. This is an array of the following fields:

- `name`: An identifier for the data element.
  Subject to the naming restrictions of [factName](#factname).
- `type`: The expected type of data to be collected, either `array` or a primitive type
  (`string`, `int`, etc.)
- `jsonPath`: A period delimited path to the desired `json`/`yaml` element.
- `items`: A optional field with a single `type` property. If included, the data returned by the
  fact will be an array of all matching elements of the specified type. If omitted, the
  returned value will be a single element.

#### Sample JSON/YAML Configuration

The `yaml` below defines both collection types performed by the JSON/YAML Extractor: single element capture and array
capture.

Sample fact definitions are as follows:

```yaml
collects:
  - factName: entity_metadata_fact # Name of the fact
    type: json # Type of the fact
    path: /catalog-info.yaml # Path to the file whose contents will be searched
    data: # Data describing the file contents collected at each jsonPath
      - name: tags # Name for this entry in the data element.
        jsonPath: metadata.tags # Path from which to pull data from the file.
        type: array # Type of element, array or primitive.
        items: # For the array type, this items specification and the type of the items is required.
          type: string
      - name: pager_duty_integration_key
        jsonPath: metadata.annotations.pagerduty_integration-key
        type: string # For non-array captures, just the type of the data is required.
```

The above `data` specifications correspond to the two types supported by this extractor, arrays
and strings, respectively. The `jsonPath` of `metadata.tags` will be extracted into an array named `tags`
of type `string`. The `jsonPath` of `metadata.annotations.pagerduty_integration-key` will be extracted into a
variable called `pager_duty_integration_key` of type `string`.

The checks for the fact data extracted by the fact specification above could be as follows:

```yaml
soundcheck:
  checks:
    - id: entity_metadata_tags_check # ID of this check
      rule: # How to evaluate this check
        factRef: scm:default/entity_metadata_fact # The fact data to reference
        path: $.tags # The path to the data in the collected fact's 'data' element
        operator: notEqual # The operation to apply
        value: undefined # The value to compare with the extracted value.
    - id: entity_metadata_key_check
      rule:
        factRef: scm:default/entity_metadata_fact
        path: $.pager_duty_integration_key
        operator: equal
        value: 12345
```

This defines two checks. The first check ensures that the `tags` array is not `undefined` in the file,
meaning that there are tags present. The second check ensures that the `pager_duty_integration_key` is in the
file and that it is equal to the given value.

Finally, these two checks are added to the `soundcheck-program.yaml` file, under an appropriate program level `ordinal`. Here's an example:

```yaml
- id: demo
  name: Demo
  ownerEntityRef: group:default/owning_group
  description: >
    Demonstration of Soundcheck Regex Fact Extractor
  levels:
    - ordinal: 1
      name: First level
      description: Checks leveraging Soundcheck's SCM Regex Fact Extractor
      checks:
        - id: entity_metadata_tags_check
          name: Entity Metadata Tags Check
          description: Check that metadata tags are present.
        - id: entity_metadata_key_check
          name: Entity Metadata Key Check
          description: Check that the pager duty key is correct.
```

Adding both checks to the `soundcheck-programs.yaml` means that they must pass for the corresponding program and level to be considered as *passing*.
