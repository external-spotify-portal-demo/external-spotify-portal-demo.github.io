The Tech Insights integration plugin for [Soundcheck](https://backstage.spotify.com/plugins/soundcheck/) exposes facts from [Tech Insights](/spotify-for-backstage-docs/insights/) to Soundcheck, allowing them to be used in Soundcheck checks.

## Prerequisites

### Add the TechInsightsHubFactCollector to Soundcheck

First, add the `@spotify/backstage-plugin-soundcheck-backend-module-techinsights` package: 

```bash
yarn workspace backend add @spotify/backstage-plugin-soundcheck-backend-module-techinsights
```

Then, in `packages/backend/src/plugins/soundcheck.ts`, add the `TechInsightsFactCollector`:

```diff
  import { SoundcheckBuilder } from '@spotify/backstage-plugin-soundcheck-backend';
  import { Router } from 'express';
  import { PluginEnvironment } from '../types';
+ import { TechInsightsFactCollector } from '@spotify/backstage-plugin-soundcheck-backend-module-techinsights';

  export default async function createPlugin(
    env: PluginEnvironment,
  ): Promise<Router> {
    return SoundcheckBuilder.create({ ...env })
+     .addFactCollectors(
+       TechInsightsFactCollector.create({
+         discovery: env.discovery,
+         tokenManager: env.tokenManager,
+         logger: env.logger,
+       }),
+     )
      .build();
  }
```

Consult the the [Soundcheck Backend documentation](https://spotify.github.io/spotify-for-backstage-docs/soundcheck/setup-and-installation#backend-setup)
for additional details on setting up the Soundcheck backend.

## Using TechInsight facts in Soundcheck

Soundcheck fact references for this plugin follow the format `techinsights:default/<id>` where `<id>`
is the fact retriever identifier from Tech Insights. 

For example, if there is a Tech Insights fact retriever with an ID of `entityOwnershipFactRetriever`, its Soundcheck fact reference would be
`techinsights:default/entityOwnershipFactRetriever`.

Soundcheck fact references enable facts from Tech Insights to be used in Soundcheck check. Here is an example of a Soundcheck check that makes use of a fact from Tech Insights.

```yaml
id: has-owner
rule:
  factRef: techinsights:default/entityOwnershipFactRetriever
  path: $.hasOwner
  operator: equal
  value: true
```

When this check is executed, it will pull the fact(s) with a fact retriever identifier of `entityOwnershipFactRetriever` from Tech Insights and perform the specified check logic on it.

Currently, the collection of facts from Tech Insights is not scheduled or cached. Tech Insights facts are only
collected on demand, when a check using a Tech Insights fact is executed (which can be scheduled).
