A check is a comparison between a defined acceptable outcome and the actual outcome of a given process.
Checks indicate where the software aligns to or deviates from organizational standards and best practices.

![Soundcheck Checks](https://spotify-plugins-for-backstage-readme-images.spotifycdn.com/soundcheck-checks.png)

Checks consist of four components: facts, paths, operators, and values.
These components are then organized via a Boolean calculator in the UI.
You can see an example of the rule layout a user will see when creating a check in the image below.

## Managing checks via the no-code UI

### Creating a check

To create a check, select the facts that you want to use, organize them into rules and give your check a meaningful name and a description.
The rules are what defines a check and what a track will use in determining if an entity passes or fails.
Simple expressions can be combined using Any Of / All Of to create more complex rules.
You also have the option of adding Pass/Fail messages for additional details of why something passed/failed.

### Editing a check

Once a check is created, you will be able to manage and edit your check on its detail page.
Youâ€™ll find no differences in how the pages look when creating/editing a check.
From the checks listing page, you will see an option to edit you check, which will bring you to the details page shown below.

![Soundcheck Edit Check](https://spotify-plugins-for-backstage-readme-images.spotifycdn.com/soundcheck-edit-check.png)

You can make as many changes as desired, but just keep in mind that changes are reflected in tracks that may already have said check assigned.
Checks can also be a part of multiple tracks, which could have the unintentional effect of causing some tracks to start failing.
While the track you want the check updated in may pass, a track setup somewhere else may fail.

## Managing checks via yaml configuration

Checks can be created in code via yaml configuration files.

### Overall shape of a Check

A fact check defines a [rule](#rules), comprised of one or more conditions: a combination of facts, [operators](#operators), and values that determine whether the check emits a `passed` or `failed` check result to Soundcheck. Required fields include `id` and `rule`.

> Note: the `id` field is a unique identifier for the check. It is used to reference the check in tracks and within the Soundcheck UI. It must be unique across all checks in your library.

Here is an example of a basic check (more [examples](#examples)):

```yaml
id: has_pagerduty_integration_key
rule:
  factRef: catalog:default/entity_descriptor
  path: $.metadata.annotations[pagerduty.com/integration-key]
  operator: matches
  value: .+
  failedMessage: |
    No PagerDuty Integration Key defined for this entity.
  passedMessage: |
    PagerDuty Integration Key defined for this entity.
```

### Adding yaml checks to your check library

To add checks defined in a yaml file to your check library, you need to source them in you `app-config.yaml`. You have the option of storing them locally or remotely.

Here is an example configuration should your check yaml files be local to your Backstage project:

```yaml title=app-config.yaml
soundcheck:
  checks:
    - $include: ./path-to-local-folder/checks-file-1.yaml
    - $include: ./path-to-local-folder/checks-file-2.yaml
    - $include: ./path-to-local-folder/checks-file-3.yaml
```

To maintain your checks files in a remote repo, you can source them in `app-config.yaml` in a similar manner. Here is an example configuration:

```yaml title=app-config.yaml
soundcheck:
  checks:
    - https://github.com/user/repo/blob/main/checks-file-1.yaml
    - https://github.com/user/repo/blob/main/checks-file-2.yaml
    - https://github.com/user/repo/blob/main/checks-file-3.yaml
  remote_file_updates:
    disabled: false
    frequency:
      minutes: 5
```

> Note: you cannot combine local and remote sourcing for checks files. This includes the usage of `$include` within a remotely sourced checks file. The below option will NOT work:

```yaml title=app-config.yaml
soundcheck:
  checks:
    - https://github.com/user/repo/blob/main/checks-file-1.yaml
    - https://github.com/user/repo/blob/main/checks-file-2.yaml
    - $include: ./path-to-local-folder/checks-file-3.yaml
```

#### Remote file update options

The `remote_file_updates` object is optional configuration allowing you to control if and when Soundcheck looks for updates within your remote files. This configuration is global for Soundcheck, so will apply to both track and check files. If not explicitly set, see the below for default values.

| Key         | Default    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ----------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `disabled`  | false      | Enables Soundcheck to look for updates in remote files                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `frequency` | minutes: 5 | The frequency at Soundcheck will look for updates in remote files. Possible values are either a cron expression `{ cron: ... }` or [`HumanDuration`](https://backstage.io/docs/reference/backend-tasks.humanduration/). |

## Check Fields

| Field            | Required | Description                                                   |
| ---------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`             | Yes      | The unique identifier for this fact check.                    |
| `name`           | No       | A name for the fact check suitable for display on a UI.       |
| `description`    | No       | A description of the fact check suitable for display on a UI. |
| `rule`           | Yes      | One or more conditions that determine check result.           |
| `passedMessage`  | No       | Message if the check passes.                                  |
| `failedMessage`  | No       | Message if the check fails.                                   |
| `schedule`       | No       | How often and on what entities the fact check should run.     |
| `ownerEntityRef` | No       | Reference to the owner of the check.                          |

Below is an example fact check which checks if a PagerDuty integration key is present in an entity's metadata:

### Rules

A rule contains one or more conditions.

The simplest form of a condition consists of a fact reference, an [operator](#operators),
and a _value_. When the check is executed, the operator is
used to compare the fact against the value.

Example of a simple condition:

```yaml
rule:
  factRef: catalog:default/entity_descriptor
  path: $.metadata.annotations[pagerduty.com/integration-key]
  operator: matches
  value: .+
  failedMessage: |
    No PagerDuty Integration Key defined for this entity.
```

More complex conditions can by created through the use of boolean expressions. A rule may
optionally have either an `all` or an `any` expression at its root, containing an array of
conditions. The `all` operator specifies that _all_ conditions
contained within must be truthy for the check to pass. The `any` operator only requires one
condition to be truthy for the check to pass.

Example of a complex condition:

```yaml
rule:
  any:
    - factRef: catalog:default/entity_descriptor
      path: $.metadata.labels['language']
      operator: equal
      value: java
    - factRef: catalog:default/entity_descriptor
      path: $.metadata.labels['language']
      operator: equal
      value: kotlin
```

### Operators

| Operator               | Description                                                  |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `equal`                | Fact must equal value.                                       |
| `notEqual`             | Fact must not equal value.                                   |
| `matches`              | Fact string matches given value regex.                       |
| `semverGt`             | Fact version must be greater than value version.             |
| `semverGte`            | Fact version must be greater than or equal to value version. |
| `semverLt`             | Fact version must be less than value version.                |
| `semverLte`            | Fact version must be less than or equal to value version.    |
| `semverEq`             | Fact version must equal value version.                       |
| `semverNeq`            | Fact version must not equal value version.                   |
| `semverSatisfies`      | Fact version satisfies value range.                          |
| `semverGtr`            | Fact version is greater than all versions in value range.    |
| `semverLtr`            | Fact version is less than all versions in value range.       |
| `lessThan`             | Fact must be less than value.                                |
| `lessThanInclusive`    | Fact must be less than or equal to value.                    |
| `greaterThan`          | Fact must be greater than value.                             |
| `greaterThanInclusive` | Fact must be greater than or equal to value.                 |
| `in`                   | Fact must be included in array value.                        |
| `notIn`                | Fact must not be included in array value.                    |
| `contains`             | Fact array must include value.                               |
| `doesNotContain`       | Fact array must not include value.                           |

### Schedule

Scheduling options for fact checks:

| Field        | Required | Description                                                     |
| ------------ | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `frequency`  | Yes      | Cron expression or HumanDuration for check execution frequency. |
| `entityRefs` | No       | Entities to run check on (overrides filter).                    |
| `filter`     | No       | Filter for entities to run check on.                            |

### Messages

Pass messages - `passedMessage` - are displayed to the user when a check passes. Fail messages - `failedMessage` - are displayed to the user
when a check fails. Messages can be provided as a string or as a markdown string. Pass and fail messages
also support [Liquid templating](https://liquidjs.com/tutorials/intro-to-liquid.html). The following variables are available for use in templates:

- `entity` - The entity the check was executed on.
- `facts` - A map of facts used by the check. Individual facts can be looked up in this map by fact reference.
  For example, `facts['catalog:default/entity_descriptor']`.
  - If all the facts used by the check have unique fact names they can be accessed in `facts` by fact name rather than
    having to use the entire fact reference. For example, if check uses the `catalog:default/entity_descriptor` it can
    be accessed by `facts['catalog:default/entity_descriptor']` or `facts['entity_descriptor']`.
  - If only a single fact is used by the check, the fact can be accessed directly. For example, if
    `catalog:default/entity_descriptor` was the only fact used by the check it can be accessed as `fact` rather than
    `facts['catalog:default/entity_descriptor']`.

Here is an example of a pass message using templates:

```md
{{ entity.metadata.name }} has a PagerDuty Integration Key defined.
```

in this example, Soundcheck would replace `{{ entity.metadata.name }}` with the name of the entity the check was
executed on.

## Executing Checks

Fact checks are executed by Soundcheck:

1. When a dependent fact is updated.
2. Via scheduled execution based on frequency and entities.
3. Manually triggered via the [Checks API](#checks-api).

For more details, refer to the original documentation.

## REST API

We include a REST API for Checks. See [API Reference](../api.mdx#checks-api) for details.

## Check Result History

By default, Soundcheck retains only the latest result for each check, so that
the size of the database is a function of the number of entities and the number
of of checks, rather than the number of check _results_. However, it's possible
to enable tracking of check result history in order to track the change in check
results over time.

Soundcheck does not currently provide an API or UI for interacting with check
result history. However, it's possible for other systems to integrate with check
result history by reading from the Soundcheck database directly.

### Enabling Check Result History

To enable check result history, set `soundcheck.results.history.enable` to true
in config:

```yaml title=app-config.yaml
soundcheck:
  results:
    history:
      enable: true
```

### Reading Check Result History

Check result history is stored in the `check_result_history` table in the
Soundcheck database. Unless [overridden in Backstage
configuration](https://backstage.io/docs/tutorials/configuring-plugin-databases#connection-configuration-per-plugin),
the Soundcheck database will be part of the main Backstage database, and named
`backstage_plugin_soundcheck`.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM check_result_history
WHERE entity_ref = 'component:default/example-component';
```

The table contains the same fields as the (object accepted by the check result
submission endpoint)[#check-result-schema], along with a unique `check_result_history_id` field and a
`timestamp` corresponding to the time the result was submitted.
