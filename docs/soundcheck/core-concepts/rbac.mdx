Admins can now use the RBAC plugin to manage (allow and restrict) what individual users or groups can do within Soundcheck.

Soundcheck’s No-Code UI integrates with Backstage’s permission framework on the RBAC plugin. This integration enables restricting which users/groups can Create, Read, Update, or Delete (CRUD) Soundcheck checks and tracks.
