## What does Soundcheck help me do?
Soundcheck incentivizes quality, reliability, and alignment of your software ecosystem. With Soundcheck, engineering organizations define development and operational standards, and measure the health of software components. Soundcheck provides teams with strong guidance to cultivate behavior and improve an organization's DevOps practices. Prioritize and visualize tech health and alignment to organizational best practices within Backstage.

There are 5 fundamental elements that make up Soundcheck:

- **Check**: A standard or best practice a component is graded against.
- **Check Result**: The result of running a check against a component. Results are either pass or fail.
- **Track**: A long-term tech health initiative.
- **Level**: A group of checks that represent a milestone within a track.
- **Certification**: The outcome of passing all checks within a level.

Together, they show you how any given software component is performing against your organization's long-term tech health initiatives.
