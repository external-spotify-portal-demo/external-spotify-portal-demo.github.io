## Publishing Lifecycle

The RBAC UI facilitates the creation and management of RBAC policies. Policies go through a publishing lifecycle that includes the following stages:

1. **Draft**: Newly created policies are in draft state and do not affect Backstage behavior. You can save draft policies while working on them and return to them later.
2. **Published**: Draft policies can be published, replacing the existing policy and becoming active. Only one published policy exists at a time in Backstage.
3. **Inactive**: When a new policy is published, the previously active policy becomes inactive.
4. **Republish**: Inactive policies can be republished at any time to become active again.

## Policy Overview

The RBAC policy is configured by defining one or more **roles**, to which you can add users/groups as members. Each role can have multiple **permission decisions** configured, which match one or more **permissions**, and specify the authorization **decision** that should be made for those permissions.

Users can be a member of multiple roles, and roles can overlap in the permissions they match. When a given permission matches multiple times, the **first match** will be the one used to determine the decision returned.

## Matching permissions

Permissions are a core concept in the Backstage permission framework. Each plugin can define a set of permissions that control what users can see and do within that plugin. Each [permission](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/plugins/permission-common/src/types/permission.ts#L39) is an object with the following fields:

- **name**: a string which uniquely identifies the permission, such as `catalog.entity.read`
- **attributes**: an object containing attributes which describe the characteristics of the permission, to allow matching multiple permissions when making a policy decision. We expect the number of supported attributes to increase over time, but for now, the only attribute is `action`, which can be set to `"create"`, `"read"`, `"update"`, or `"delete"`.
- **resourceType**: the type of resource expected to be supplied when authorizing this permission, if applicable (for example `catalog-entity`).

In the RBAC UI, it's possible to match a single specific permission by name, or to match using a combination of resourceType and actions in order to match multiple permissions with a single entry in the list. It's also possible to match all permissions with a single entry - this is mostly useful for defining a fallback at the end of your policy, in case no other permission decision in the policy matched a request.

## Specifying decisions

The RBAC UI supports definitive `allow` or `deny` decisions, as well as [conditional decisions](https://backstage.io/docs/permissions/writing-a-policy#conditional-decisions) whose result can vary based on characteristics of the resource being authorized. Conditional decisions can only be returned for permissions with a resourceType - the RBAC UI handles enabling and disabling the "conditional" option as needed.

Conditional decisions contain one or more **conditions**, which are exported by permissioned plugins and tied to a resourceType. The condition `HAS_ANNOTATION`, for example, is tied to the `catalog-entity` resourceType, and checks whether a catalog entity has a certain annotation. Multiple conditions can be combined using "any of" (return `allow` when any one of these conditions is true), or "all of" (only return `allow` when all of these conditions is true). It's also possible to negate conditions using "not", and combinations of conditions and logical operators can be deeply nested if needed.

## Additonal features

### Import / Export

The RBAC plugin allows users to export existing policies, a feature which can be found within the policy page. You can import the resulting yaml file back into RBAC, which will result in a draft policy identical to the exported policy. This can be useful when working with multiple Backstage instances with similar configurations.

### Default policy

The RBAC plugin allows Backstage administrators to configure a default policy for deployment. Setting a default policy allows RBAC to enforce an active policy from the start, before any administrator has interacted with the RBAC UI. You can set a default policy by:

1. Create a draft policy in the RBAC UI that represents the policy that you would like to become the default policy.
1. Go to the draft policy page, and download the policy by clicking "Export." Alternatively, you can export any previous version or the active policy from the respective policy pages.
1. Add a `defaultPolicy` field under the `rbac` field in your `app-config.yaml`, and point it to the file you saved from the previous step:

```yaml
permission:
  rbac:
    defaultPolicy:
      $include: ./default-rbac-policy.yaml
```

1. You should now see that your Backstage instance behaves as configured in your default policy, even though you have not yet authored any other policies using the RBAC UI.

**NOTE:** The default policy will be active if and only if no other active policies already exist.

### Fallback policy

By default, when a request to the RBAC backend fails, RBAC will automatically switch to denying all permissions. You can configure this behavior by specifying a fallback policy in your `app-config.yaml` in the exact same way as the default policy:

```yaml
permission:
  rbac:
    fallbackPolicy:
      $include: ./fallback-rbac-policy.yaml
```

### Decision resolution strategy

Multiple decisions from multiple roles could be applicable to a single user when authorizing a permission request. By default, the `any-allow` strategy will be selected for a new policy. Please select the decision resolution strategy that makes sense for your policy.

> Please note the selected strategy will be applied to the whole policy and greatly affects the outcome of permission decisions.

#### `any-allow` strategy

The first allow decision from all of the roles and decisions is the final result. A single explicit allow or an allow as a result of a conditional decision would result in a final allow decision, otherwise the decision is deny.

> With this option, the order of roles and decisions does not matter.

#### `first-match` strategy

The first matching decision from the first matching role that is applicable to the user is the final result, regardless if that decision is an allow, deny or conditional.

> With this option, the order in which you define roles and decisions matters.

#### How to change the desicion resolution strategy for a policy

You can change the decision resolution strategy for a policy and read more about the options by following the steps below:

1. Go to the draft policy page and click the `more options` icon on the top right.
2. Select `Options`.
3. Select which resolution strategy makes sense for your policy.
4. Click `Back to Policy` when you are done. Your policy will be automatically updated with your selection, and it will be saved and/or published when save and publish your policy.
