# Setup & Installation

## Prerequisites

### Configure the Sign-In Resolver

To allow Insights to identify the user entity associated with the signed-in user, your **SignInResolver** must issue an identity token with a **sub** (subject) claim pointing to the user entity in the catalog corresponding to the signed-in user. Check out [Backstage user identity documentation on backstage.io](https://backstage.io/docs/auth/identity-resolver/#backstage-user-identity) for complete details on how to supplly an identity resolver.

While many authentication providers handle this automatically, if you're using a custom provider, you might need to implement this behavior yourself. Refer to examples in the [Google auth sign-in resolver](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/plugins/auth-backend/src/providers/google/provider.ts) or the [GitHub auth sign-in resolver](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/plugins/auth-backend/src/providers/github/provider.ts). For more information on configuring a sign-in resolver, see the [identity resolver documentation on backstage.io](https://backstage.io/docs/auth/identity-resolver).

## Backend Installation

### Obtain the Plugin

Add the Insights backend as a dependency to your Backstage backend app:

```bash
yarn workspace backend add @spotify/backstage-plugin-insights-backend
```

### Integrate the Plugin

Create a new file named `packages/backend/src/plugins/backstageInsights.ts` with the following content:

```ts title=packages/backend/src/backstageInsights.ts
import { Router } from 'express';
import { PluginEnvironment } from '../types';
import { createRouter } from '@spotify/backstage-plugin-insights-backend';

export default async function createPlugin(
  env: PluginEnvironment
): Promise<Router> {
  return await createRouter({
    ...env,
  });
}
```

Next, wire up the Insights backend in `packages/backend/src/index.ts`. Import the module from the previous step, create a plugin environment, and add the router to the Express app.

```ts title=packages/backend/src/index.ts
...

import proxy from './plugins/proxy';
import techdocs from './plugins/techdocs';
import search from './plugins/search';
// highlight-next-line
import backstageInsights from './plugins/backstageInsights';

...

const techdocsEnv = createEnv('techdocs');
const searchEnv = createEnv('search');
const appEnv = createEnv('app');
// highlight-next-line
const backstageInsightsEnv = createEnv('backstageInsights');

...

apiRouter.use('/techdocs', await techdocs(techdocsEnv));
apiRouter.use('/proxy', await proxy(proxyEnv));
apiRouter.use('/search', await search(searchEnv));
// highlight-next-line
apiRouter.use('/backstage-insights', await backstageInsights(backstageInsightsEnv));
```

**Note:** be sure to use "backstage-insights" exactly as your route in the above file

#### New Backend System

If you are using the New Backend System, you can use the
[`legacyPlugin` helper function](https://backstage.io/docs/reference/backend-common.legacyplugin/) to integrate the plugin backend with your Backstage backend.

```ts title=packages/backend/src/index.ts
import { createBackend } from '@backstage/backend-defaults';
// highlight-next-line
import { legacyPlugin } from '@backstage/backend-common';

const backend = createBackend();

backend.add(import('@backstage/plugin-app-backend/alpha'));
// highlight-next-line
backend.add(
  legacyPlugin('backstage-insights', import('./plugins/backstageInsights'))
);
// ...

backend.start();
```

### Create an API Token for Your Organization

To secure communication between your Backstage backend and Spotify's servers, you need to create an API token. Visit [backstage.spotify.com/account/tokens](https://backstage.spotify.com/account/tokens/) and create a token with a descriptive name, such as `backstage-insights-production-token`. Note down the token value as you'll need it in the next step.

### Configure the Spotify Backstage API Token

In your `app-config.yaml`, add the following entry to enable communication with Spotify's servers:

```yaml title=app-config.yaml
spotify:
  apiToken: ${SPOTIFY_BACKSTAGE_API_TOKEN}
```

Set the `SPOTIFY_BACKSTAGE_API_TOKEN` environment variable to the API token you created earlier. Ensure that you treat this value as a secret and avoid checking it into version control.

## Additional Configuration

### Extra Entity Metadata Capture

The Insights backend integrates with the Software Catalog to enhance analytics events with additional entity metadata. This allows filtering or grouping data based on attributes like the entity's `type`. By default, the following fields are captured on analytics events associated with catalog entities: `kind`, `metadata.namespace`, `spec.type`, `spec.lifecycle`, and `spec.owner`. To capture extra fields, provide them in the configuration. Common fields can be found in the [Catalog's YAML File Format documentation](https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-catalog/descriptor-format). You can also reference custom metadata stored on entities.

```yaml title=app-config.yaml
backstageInsights:
  captureEntityFields:
    - spec.someCustomField
```

Similarly, certain fields are captured on all analytics events related to the signed-in user, such as `metadata.namespace` and `spec.memberOf`. You can configure additional user metadata capture in the configuration as well:

```yaml title=app-config.yaml
backstageInsights:
  captureIdentityFields:
    - spec.profile.someCustomField
```

Note that the Insights backend applies redaction logic to avoid collecting personal data, but you should understand the data collected when configuring these additional fields.

### Total Users Count Filter

The Insights frontend uses the Software Catalog to determine the total number of users who can access Backstage. This number is essential for various dashboards and views. If the count is incorrect due to factors like retaining deactivated users or gradual rollouts, you can apply filters using an [EntityFilterQuery][efq]. Examples include counting members of a specific group or users under a certain namespace.

```yaml title=app-config.yaml
backstageInsights:
  totalUsersEntityQueryFilter:
    'relations.memberOf': 'group:default/rnd'
```

For more details, refer to the [EntityFilterQuery documentation on backstage.io](https://backstage.io/docs/reference/catalog-client.entityfilterquery).

## Frontend Installation - Adding the Insights API

### Get the Plugin

Add the Insights Analytics Module as a dependency to your Backstage frontend app:

```bash
yarn workspace app add @spotify/backstage-plugin-analytics-module-insights
```

### Supply the BackstageInsights API implementation in your app

This is typically done in `/packages/app/src/apis.ts`, or less often directly in the call to `createApp()`.

```ts title=/packages/app/src/apis.ts
...
import { BackstageInsights } from '@spotify/backstage-plugin-analytics-module-insights';

export const apis = [
  ...
  BackstageInsights.createDefaultApiFactory(),
];
```

### Configure the Backstage Insights API

Generate a random string, for example with the following terminal one-liner:

```bash
node -p 'require("crypto").randomBytes(24).toString("base64")'
```

Then add the following configuration to your `app-config.yaml`, substituting the random string you just generated for the `salt` value.

```yaml title=app-config.yaml
backstageInsights:
  salt: randomly-generated-string-here
  debug: true
```

The `debug` property is set to `true`, which will output data to local logs instead of sending it to the production API. Don't forget to supply an override in your `app-config.production.yaml`:

```yaml title=app-config.production.yaml
backstageInsights:
  debug: false
```

> Note: The backstageInsights.salt value is used to hash user identifiers in the insights event data that is sent to Spotify. This value is secret to Spotify (meaning: Spotify should never have access to this value), but it does not need to be treated as a secret within your organization (meaning: feel free to check this value in).

### Check everything is working

Start up backstage locally. For the sake of testing, you could provide any necessary overrides as environment variables inline, like this:

```bash
SPOTIFY_BACKSTAGE_API_TOKEN="{your token}" \
  APP_CONFIG_backstageInsights_debug=false \
  yarn dev
```

Once the app is built and running, open the app in your browser and open the browser's network console; check for requests being made against the insights backend with a path containing `backstage-insights/events`. As you navigate around Backstage, those requests should receive a `204` response if everything is configured correctly.

Once you've verified your configuration locally, deploy your changes to production (ensuring that you properly set the `SPOTIFY_BACKSTAGE_API_TOKEN` variable in your production environment). Perform the same network request checks in your production Backstage.

### Troubleshooting

If you're not seeing what's described in the `Check everything is working section`, here are a few common misconfigurations to be aware of:

- Are you seeing a `401` or `404` response instead of a `204`? There are two key items to check:
  - Check that you've set the `SPOTIFY_BACKSTAGE_API_TOKEN` environment variable as expected.
  - Be sure that you set the path correctly when you wired up the Insights backend. It should be `/backstage-insights`, as in `apiRouter.use('/backstage-insights', /* etc */)`.
- Are you not seeing any matching network requests at all? Check that you've set the `backstageInsights.salt` value as expected. A missing value could result in the analytics API instantiation failing silently. It's also possible that `backstageInsights.debug` is mistakenly set to `true` (if this is the case, you'll see backstageInsights logs in your browser's console log). Make sure that your app is loading in all relevant configuration files (`app-config.yaml` as well as `app-config.production.yaml`).
- Are you seeing an error similar to `tried to register duplicate or forbidden API factory` when you load the frontend? This is likely because you already have an analytics implementation supplied in your `apis.ts` file. To resolve, you can use the `MultipleAnalyticsApi` class to supply your existing analytics implementation alongside Backstage Insights. In place of `BackstageInsights.createDefaultApiFactory()`, you could do something similar to the following:

```ts title=/packages/app/src/apis.ts
import {
  analyticsApiRef,
  configApiRef,
  createApiFactory,
  discoveryApiRef,
  fetchApiRef,
  identityApiRef,
  storageApiRef,
} from '@backstage/core-plugin-api';
// highlight-start
import { MultipleAnalyticsApi } from '@backstage/core-app-api';
import { BackstageInsightsApi } from '@spotify/backstage-plugin-analytics-module-insights';
BackstageInsights.createDefaultApiFactory(),
import { YourExistingAnalyticsApi } from '@somewhere/else';
// highlight-end

export const apis = [
  ...
  createApiFactory({
    api: analyticsApiRef,
    deps: {
      configApi: configApiRef,
      discoveryApi: discoveryApiRef,
      fetchApi: fetchApiRef,
      identityApi: identityApiRef,
      storageApi: storageApiRef,
    },
    factory: ({
      configApi,
      discoveryApi,
      fetchApi,
      identityApi,
      storageApi,
    }) =>
    // highlight-start
      MultipleAnalyticsApi.fromApis([
        BackstageInsightsApi.fromConfig(configApi, {
          discoveryApi,
          fetchApi,
          identityApi,
          storageApi,
        }),
        YourExistingAnalyticsApi.fromConfig(configApi, {
          ...
        }),
      ]),
    // highlight-end
    ...
  }),
];
```

### New Insights backend plugin

> If this is your first time installing Backstage Insights, you can safely ignore this section. However, if you are currently using a version of `@spotify/backstage-plugin-analytics-module-insights` that is `v0.6.1` or earlier, you will need to migrate using the following guide.

Follow these instructions on how to [migrate to the new Insights backend plugin](/spotify-for-backstage-docs/insights/migrating-to-new-insights-backend)

## Frontend Installation - Adding the UI

### Get the Plugin

Add the Insights frontend as a dependency to your Backstage frontend app:

```bash
yarn workspace app add @spotify/backstage-plugin-insights
```

### Install the Insights frontend

Wire up routing to the `InsightsPage` entry page. The route should look something like this:

```tsx title=packages/app/src/App.tsx
// highlight-next-line
import { InsightsPage } from '@spotify/backstage-plugin-insights';
...

/* Configure the route location for the Search plugin inside bindRoutes */

bindRoutes({ bind }) {
   ...
   // highlight-start
  bind(insightsPlugin.externalRoutes, {
    searchPageRouteRef: searchPlugin.routes.root,
  });
   // highlight-end
   ...
}

...

const routes = (
  <FlatRoutes>
    <Navigate key="/" to="catalog" />
     ...
     { /* highlight-next-line */}
     <Route path="/insights" element={<InsightsPage />} />
     ...
  </FlatRoutes>
);
```

Add a sidebar menu item that routes to the path setup in the previous step:

```tsx title=packages/app/src/components/Root/Root.tsx
...
// highlight-next-line
import { InsightsSidebarItem } from '@spotify/backstage-plugin-insights'
...

<SidebarScrollWrapper>
  <SidebarItem icon={MapIcon} to="tech-radar" text="Tech Radar" />
    ...
    {/* highlight-next-line */}
    <InsightsSidebarItem />
    ...
</SidebarScrollWrapper>;

...
```

### Configure Access Controls

If you currently permission access to catalog resources, you'll likey want to configure who can access Insights as it could potentially expose information from the catalog that users might not normally have permissions to see.

The recommended approaches to setting access controls for this plugin require the Backstage permissions framework. You may have set up this up already when configuring other plugins from the Spotify bundle, but if not, [follow this guide to setting up the permissions framework](https://backstage.io/docs/permissions/overview).

#### Option 1: Use the RBAC Plugin (Recommended)

_"The [RBAC plugin](https://backstage.spotify.com/plugins/rbac) is a no-code management UI for restricting access to plugins, routes, and data within Backstage. Admins can quickly define roles, assign users and groups, and configure permissions to encode authorization decisions according to your organization's evolving security and compliance needs."_

To have access to Insights permissions within the RBAC UI, be sure to add `backstage-insights` to the list of `permissionedPlugins` in your `app-config.yaml`.

```yaml title=app-config.yaml
  permission:
    enabled: true
   permissionedPlugins:
     - catalog
     - scaffolder
    // highlight-next-line
     - backstage-insights
   ...
```

Using the [RBAC plugin](/spotify-for-backstage-docs/rbac/), it's easy to define access controls for Insights with the single `insights.read` permission:

![An Insights Admin role set up via the RBAC plugin](https://spotify-plugins-for-backstage-readme-images.spotifycdn.com/insights-rbac-setup.png)

Here is a basic sample `any-allow` policy that allows general access to the catalog and templates but restricts access to the Insights plugin to the group `backstage-admins`:

```yaml title=sample-policy.yaml
name: Sample Insights Policy
description: null
options:
  resolutionStrategy: any-allow
roles:
  - name: Default user
    members: '*'
    permissions:
      - match:
          resourceType: scaffolder-action
        decision: allow
      - match:
          resourceType: scaffolder-template
        decision: allow
      - match:
          resourceType: catalog-entity
        decision: allow
  - name: Admin
    members:
      - group:default/backstage-admins
    permissions:
      - match: '*'
        decision: allow
```

> To get started with this sample policy, save the content as a `yaml` file and follow the [RBAC import policy instructions](/spotify-for-backstage-docs/rbac/setup-and-installation#import-and-export-a-policy).

#### Option 2: Use Custom Policy Handlers

If you don't use the RBAC plugin, you can define [custom policy handlers](https://backstage.io/docs/permissions/writing-a-policy) for permission framework policies.

```ts title=packages/backend/src/plugins/permissions.ts
class ExamplePolicy implements PermissionPolicy {
  async handle(request: PolicyQuery): Promise<PolicyDecision> {
    if (request.permission.name === 'insights.read') {
      const isAllowed = await someEvaluationFunction();

      if (isAllowed) {
        return {
          result: AuthorizeResult.ALLOW,
        };
      }
    }

    return { result: AuthorizeResult.DENY };
  }
}
```

### Integrate the Plugin with Your Frontend App

Install the Insights routes in your app within `packages/app/src/App.tsx` and configure the route location for the Search plugin. You can also add a sidebar item for easy access to Insights if needed.

### Verify Functionality

After setting up access controls, users with the `insights.read` permission should see an Insights sidebar menu item. Ensure that the Backend plugin is correctly configured and data has been collected for at least 48 hours for the dashboards to display meaningful information.

## Available Permissions

The Insights plugin has a single permission, `insights.read`, which controls access to the Insights plugin. This permission is used to gate access to the Insights plugin and its associated data.
