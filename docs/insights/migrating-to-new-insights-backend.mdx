# Migration & Installation

> If this is your first time installing Backstage Insights, you can safely ignore this section. However, if you are currently using a version of `@spotify/backstage-plugin-analytics-module-insights` that is `v0.6.1` or earlier, you will need to migrate using the following guide.

As of `v0.7.0`, the Backstage Insights analytics module sends events to Spotify's hosted service via a new backend plugin, rather than the proxy backend. This change was made in order to allow greater flexibility when collecting analytics events.

Support for collection via the proxy backend is now deprecated and will be removed in the next release of Backstage Insights.

# Migrating from the proxy backend

1. Upgrade to the latest version of `@spotify/backstage-plugin-analytics-module-insights` in the same way you normally bump Backstage plugin packages

2. [Install the Backstage Insights backend plugin](/spotify-for-backstage-docs/insights/setup-and-installation#backend-installation)

3. Move your existing `app.analytics.backstageInsights` config to the top-level `backstageInsights` config key in your `app-config.yaml` file:

**Prior configuration**

```yaml title=app-config.yaml
app:
  analytics:
    backstageInsights:
      salt: xyz
      debug: true # for local development
```

**New configuration**

```yaml title=app-config.yaml
backstageInsights:
  salt: xyz
  debug: true # for local development
```

> Ensure these changes are replicated in other config files, e.g. `app-config.production.yaml`.

4. Be sure to configure the Spotify API token in the same way that you had it configured on the proxy (e.g. by using the same environment variable name) in your `app-config.yaml` file:

**Prior configuration**

```yaml title=app-config.yaml
proxy:
  '/spotify-backstage-api':
    target: 'https://backstage-api.spotify.com'
    headers:
      Authorization: Bearer ${SPOTIFY_BACKSTAGE_API_TOKEN}
```

**New configuration**

```yaml title=app-config.yaml
spotify:
  apiToken: ${SPOTIFY_BACKSTAGE_API_TOKEN}
```

> Ensure these changes are replicated in other config files, e.g. `app-config.production.yaml`.

# Verifying the migration

After running through the migration steps above, you can verify that everything is working as expected by following these [check everything is working](/spotify-for-backstage-docs/insights/setup-and-installation/#check-everything-is-working) instructions.

If you encounter any issues while verifying the migration, check the [troubleshooting](/spotify-for-backstage-docs/insights/setup-and-installation/#troubleshooting) documentation.

If you find that analytics event requests are being made, but they are being made to a path like `/api/proxy`, be sure that youâ€™ve successfully upgraded the `@spotify/backstage-plugin-analytics-module-insights` package to the latest version.

# Rolling back to the proxy backend

If you are unable to upgrade successfully, please get in touch with us using our support form! In the meantime, you can set `backstageInsights.useProxy` to `true` in order to temporarily use the data collection mechanism from prior releases:

```yaml title=app-config.yaml
backstageInsights:
  useProxy: true # Temporarily use Proxy Backend
```
